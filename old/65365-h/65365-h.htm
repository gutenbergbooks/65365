I REALLY can say nothing of my earliest
days except from report. I have
heard, but I can hardly believe it,
that I was once part of a rough mass
of iron ore, that had lain for ages in
a dark mine in Cornwall; that I was dug out,
and put into a huge furnace, and heated till I
became red-hot, and melted; that I was made
into part of an iron bar, and when in a fiery
glow was suddenly plunged into cold water,
which changed my whole constitution and
name, for iron was thenceforth called steel. I
can just fancy how the water fizzed and hissed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>and how my fiery flush faded suddenly away,
and I became again quite black in the face! I
can fancy all this, as I said, but I really remember
nothing about it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nor have I any recollection of being drawn
out into wire, forced to push myself through
little holes, smaller and smaller, till I was long
enough and slim enough for the purpose for
which the manufacturer designed me. My
very earliest remembrance is of finding myself
lying on an anvil, along with thousands of
others of my species. But you must not fancy
me then, gentle reader, in the least like the
neat, trim, bright little article that now has the
pleasure of addressing you. I fancy that I
looked uncommonly like a bit of steel wire,
neither useful nor ornamental.</p>

<p class='c006'>While I lay quietly reflecting in a kind of
dull, sleepy doze, for at that time I was not
sharp at all, a violent blow on one end of me
startled me not a little—I had been hit on
that side as flat as a pancake!</p>

<p class='c006'>“What next?” thought I. I had little
time for thinking. I was popped into the fire
in a minute, but taken out again before I had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>time to melt. Then down came another blow
upon me, which had quite a different effect
from the first. It pierced out a little hole in
my flat head, and I received the advantage of
having an eye. No sooner did I possess it than
I began to use it. I peered around me with
much curiosity, now on the long brick building
in which I found myself; now on the rough
care-worn faces of the workmen, reddened by
the glow of the fire-light; now on the multitude
of baby needles around me, all looking up
with their little round eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>I was now placed upon a block of lead, and
my eye was punched to bring out the little bit
of steel, which was neither tidy nor convenient.
Then, to improve the shape of my flat head, it
was filed a little on both sides.</p>

<p class='c006'>I felt now tolerably well satisfied with myself—something
like a child (for I have since
seen a good deal of the world) when it has
mastered the first difficulties of learning, and
begins to fancy itself a genius. But there was
a good deal more of filing, and heating, and polishing
before me; education is a slow and troublesome
matter, whether to children or needles!</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>I am afraid that I should tire you, dear
reader, were I to give you the whole story of
how I was filed into a point; how I thought
the file hard, disagreeable, and rough, as many
young folk have thought their teachers; how I
was then heated in a fire till I grew as red as
naughty boys who have been caned by their
master; then left to cool in a basin of cold
water, like the same boys shut up to think
over the matter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then I and a number of my companions
were held in a shovel over the fire, and stirred
about, and then straightened with blows of the
hammer. I thought that I must now be quite
perfect; but never was needle more mistaken.
How could I go through linen, cloth, and silk—how
could young gentlemen and ladies go
through the world—without a proper degree of
polish! Thousands of us were put on a piece
of buckram sprinkled with emery dust; more
emery dust was thrown over us, and then a
small quantity of oil; for I wish that every
teacher would remember that though the emery
of discipline is necessary enough, it works best
when laid on with the sweet oil of kindness.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Oh, if I could only describe the rolling backwards
and forwards, the rubbing and scrubbing
again and again, the washing, the wiping, the
smoothing on a stone, thought necessary to
complete a good needle! Depend upon it, dear
reader, your reading and writing, your sums
and your tables, nay, even the terrible dog’s-eared
grammar, are nothing to what the smallest
needle must go through before it is fit to
appear in the world!</p>

OUR education being now finished, two
hundred and fifty of us were packed
up together, and remained in darkness
and seclusion for some time. We
were then removed, separated, and in
smaller numbers placed in neat little dark-coloured
papers, and kept in a box in a shop.
Of all the tiresome parts of my life, this was
the most tiresome by far. I longed for the
moment when I should be taken from the
prison, and see a little of the world. I was
quite discontented with my state.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why was I made, if not to be used?”
thought I. “Why have I undergone all this
heating, hitting, and polishing? why am I so
sharp, so neat, so bright, if not to make some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>figure in the world?” I was only a young
needle, you see, and impatience is natural to
youth: I am not the only one who has found
it hard to stay contentedly in the position in
which he has been placed.</p>

<p class='c006'>At length I felt myself moved (you know
that I could see nothing out of my paper). I
believe that I had been bought and sold; and
though not at once released from my confinement,
I felt reasonable hopes that I soon should
be so. Nor were my expectations disappointed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, mamma! dear mamma! what a sweet
little work-box—and all fitted up so nicely!”
exclaimed a childish voice near me. I longed
to have a peep at the speaker.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I hope that it may assist my Lily to be a
tidy, useful little girl, such as her mother would
wish to see her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What a pretty silver thimble! and it fits
me exactly; just see! You’ve left a place for
my scissors, as I have a nice pair already.
What neat, tiny reels!—and what’s this? a
yard measure—ah! and here is wax to make
my thread strong! Thank you, dear mamma,
again and again!”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>I confess that I was rather in a state of irritation.
Nobody seemed to be thinking in the
least about me; after all my finished education,
it was not thought worth while even to give
me a look. At length my paper was moved,
very roughly torn open, light flashed upon its
contents, and I and my companions were scattered
in every direction, I alighting on the
Holland pinafore of a fair, chubby-faced boy,
who had been the author of the mischief.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Eddy! you tiresome child! if you
would only leave my box alone—just see what
you’ve done with my needles!”</p>

<p class='c006'>I seized the opportunity of looking around
me, in no hurry for my resting-place to be discovered.
I found myself in a very comfortable
room, full of so many things to excite my
curiosity, that I felt as though I could have
gazed for ever! But perhaps what interested
me most was my first sight of the human
beings who occupied the apartment. They
were so unlike the workmen to whom I had
been accustomed, that I examined them just as
a philosopher might examine some newly-discovered
curiosity.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>In the first place, there was a gentle, blue-eyed
lady, who sat near the table on which the
work-box was placed; while on her knee rested
a very plump little child, calmly engaged in
sucking her thumb. A girl of about ten years
of age (I knew nothing of ages then, and had
not a notion of anything growing, but I have
since learned much from observation) was on
her knees, searching for her needles. She was
evidently to be my future mistress, and I anxiously
glanced into her face to read what sort of
a child she might be. I scarcely knew whether
her countenance pleased me or not. She
had light eyes, like her mamma; rather a
turned-up little nose, which gave her a somewhat
saucy expression; and I am sorry to say
that, just at that moment, I saw on her brow
sundry creases, which did not give me an idea
of good temper. I know that it is a foolish
feeling of mine, but whenever I see those ugly
creases rising on the brow of a little boy or
girl, I always feel inclined to bestow on them
a little prick, just by way of good counsel, you
understand! I have seen lines, and very deep
lines, made on the forehead by care; I could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>just faintly trace some on that of Mrs. Ellerslie;
they became only too distinct in the
course of time, but they never for a moment
altered the gentle expression of her face.</p>

<p class='c006'>I think now that I hear her soft voice as
she said,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Lily, do not be so much vexed with
your brother. You know that he is only a
little boy. Come, my Eddy, let us help to
look for the needles; you must not touch the
papers again!”</p>

<p class='c006'>I cannot say much for Eddy’s skill or industry
in the search; he was much more intent
on making baby laugh by snapping his fingers
and grinning at her, turning his head knowingly
first on one side, then on the other, till
he succeeded in drawing from her a merry crow,
and a smile showed her little toothless gums.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such success elated Eddy, and, determined
to press a good kiss on that sweet little mouth,
he came close—too close to her, alas! for he
caused me to inflict, I am sorry to confess it, a
very tiny scratch on the baby’s plump white
arm.</p>

<p class='c006'>You should have heard what a scream she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>set up! I really felt quite embarrassed: was
this to be the commencement of my career, was
I to begin my services by mischief? You
must consider also, gentle reader, that my astonishment
was very great at the effect produced
by my head simply rubbing against a
child’s arm! I myself, though not a thousandth
part of the size of the baby, had borne
hammering, bruising, and battering, not only in
silence, but with little inconvenience; and here
the smallest touch seemed to excite terror and
pain such as had never even entered into my
fancy. Ah! I soon found how very different
the human species is from ours; how easily
their tender flesh is wounded, and—what I
thought still more strange—how easily their
feelings are pained! It has seemed to me,
from what I have observed in life, and from
what I have heard from companions of my
own, possessing greater experience, that there
are some human beings whose great business
seems to be, pricking and paining the hearts of
those around them; as if life were not full enough
of sorrows without our wilfully bringing them
upon our neighbours.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Eddy seemed much more penitent for having
hurt baby than for having overthrown Lily’s
paper of needles, though the latter action had
been the cause of the former. He joined his
mother and sister in trying to soothe little
Rosey, and assured her so often that he was
“very, very sorry,” and called her by so many
sweet names, “little pet, darling, and duck,”
and kissed the scratched arm so often, that she
soon appeared quite pacified. I was not so
well pleased at the titles which he gave me,
throwing all the blame on “the naughty, ugly
needle,” that had been the innocent cause of
her pain. I was rather in ill humour when
Lily hastily replaced me in the work-box, not
dreaming of putting me back in my paper, but
sticking me unceremoniously into the red silk
which lined the top of the box. And there I
was to remain, in company with other articles
of metal, with which I soon entered into acquaintance;
for all the metals are naturally
related to each other, and I was able to make
myself understood by everything bearing the
nature of a mineral.</p>

“WELL, what do you think of your new
life?” said the Scissors, as soon as
we were left quietly in the box.
Perhaps I had better pause for a
moment to describe my new companion,
before I record our conversation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The pair of Scissors, with which I had now
to make acquaintance, had rather an old-fashioned
air. One end was rounded, the other
had been sharp, but a little piece had been
broken off the point. I fancy that I detected
on one of the handles something reddish, like a
little speck of rust, and the brightness of the
whole article was dimmed. This was doubtless
a mark of antiquity, and it was in the patronizing
manner of one who was aware of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>own superiority, that Mrs. Scissors repeated her
question, “Pray, what do you think of your
new life?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have hardly had time to judge,” was my
reply; “but I am rather hurt at the way in
which that little boy laid the whole blame of
his own fault upon me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, that is what you must always expect,”
laughed the Scissors; “a bad shearer never has
good shears. I’ve been these ten years in the
family, and I’ve always found it the same.
When Miss Lily took it into her head to imitate
the hairdresser, and practise upon Eddy’s flaxen
poll, when I glanced aside, and snipped his little
ear, whose fault was that but ‘the stupid
Scissors’!’ And when I was seized upon to
open a nailed box, whose contents the young
lady was impatient to see, whose fault was
it when my poor point suddenly snapped?
why, ‘the good-for-nothing Scissors’,’ to be
sure.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I hope that I shall not be treated in such
a way,” said I, rather alarmed at her words;
“it would be too bad, after the trouble that has
been taken to form me, after having had to pass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>to perfection through so many hands, to be
snapped by a careless child.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You would have nothing but the dust-hole
before you,” said the Scissors. I thought the
remark very unpleasant.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I almost wish that I had remained in my
mine,” sighed I.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh no,” said a soft voice beside me, and I
remarked a beautiful little Thimble, of a metal
unknown to me before, so bright, and white,
and shining, that I felt at once that it was of
superior nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Would you wish,” she continued, “to lie
useless, to be of no benefit to any? Has not
man refined, formed, polished, improved you,
and exerted the powers of his reason to render
you an instrument of good?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What has man’s reason to do with us?”
said I.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know not whether I can explain myself
clearly,” replied the Thimble, “but I will endeavour
to show you what I mean. Man has
been gifted with a power called reason; by this
he governs the world, by this he subdues creatures
stronger than himself, and makes all things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>combine to serve him. He has discovered that
iron possesses a strength which he may turn to
valuable account. It would be endless labour to
plough the fields, if the ground had to be torn
up by the hand; it would be terrible work to
reap the corn, if each blade had to be pulled off
by the fingers. Man determined to aid his
own weakness by the wonderful strength of
iron. He made the ploughshare, and the furrows
are turned up; he made the sickle, and
the sheaves are gathered; huge trees, which he
would never have had force to pull down, are
laid low by a few strokes of his axe.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There is no doubt but that ours is the most
useful metal by far,” said the Scissors, with
something of a sneer. “Who would use ploughshares,
or sickles, or axes of silver? Precious
little work they would do!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I grant it,” said the Thimble, with perfect
good-humour; “but we all have our place in
the world, we all have some good purpose to
fulfil. Zinc, lead, tin, arsenic, platina, nickel—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Stop, stop,” I exclaimed, overwhelmed with
such a list; “I never knew there were so many
metals before.”</p>

observed, “how impossible must it be to count

“SEWING! how I hate sewing! I wonder
what use there is in my learning
to sew,” exclaimed Lily, in rather a
fretful tone, as she took me out of the
box.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wonder what’s the use of learning to
spell!” yawned little Eddy over a dog’s-eared
book, as he sat on a stool close by his mother.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Ellerslie was busy at her desk, examining
her monthly accounts, with a grave and
anxious expression. She was interrupted, in
the midst of summing up a long bill, by her
little girl bringing her work to her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mamma—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, my dear,” said Mrs. Ellerslie, without
raising her eyes, and continued murmuring half
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>aloud, “Thirteen pounds and a half at seven-pence
three-farthings—I thought there must be
an error somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mamma, please will you lay down the hem
for me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Really, my love, I am very busy at present.
I think that, after all the trouble which I have
taken to teach you, you might manage to do
that for yourself;” and again she went on with
her accounts; while Lily, looking rather discontented,
slowly returned to her seat.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mamma,” said Eddy, rising, and laying his
book on her knee, “I know my lesson.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wait a minute, my boy; I will hear you
almost directly.”</p>

<p class='c006'>So Eddy waited cheerfully enough, and, to
amuse himself in the meantime, began trying to
mend his mother’s pen, to the no small damage
of the pen, and the imminent risk of his own
fingers.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Eddy, put that knife down!” exclaimed
the harassed lady, when she had raised her
head for a moment to see the nature of his occupation.
“Come, you had better say your
lesson at once,” she continued, hopelessly laying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>down the bill, and taking up the spelling book.
She was too gentle, too loving, to be irritable
or peevish; but petty cares and petty troubles
were wearing out her strength, and damping
the spirits which had once been so light. I
saw that though Mrs. Ellerslie fondly loved her
children, she could not help feeling them a
weariness to her; and though they had much
affection for their mother, they had little consideration
for her comfort.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now, Eddy,” said Mrs. Ellerslie, as the
little gentleman stood with his arms pressed
down to his sides before her, “how do you spell
the word <i>pan</i>?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“B-o-y,” replied Eddy, with emphasis.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, fie! that’s not knowing your lesson.
You had better look it over again,” she continued,
as a servant brought in a note with the
words, “The messenger is waiting for an answer.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In the meantime, I was making my first
essay in sewing; and though, I assure you, it
was from no fault of mine, a lamentably bungling
essay it was. The hem laid down by my
little mistress was in some parts twice as broad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>as in others, while in one place the edge was
scarcely turned in at all. I was quite hurt at
the crooked stitches which Lily forced me to
make, and I wondered to myself whether she
worked thus from stupidity or a wilful temper.</p>

<p class='c006'>While the lady read and answered the note
in haste, Eddy sat demurely on his stool, leaning
his elbows on his knees, and his chin on the
palm of his hands, as if buried in profound
study. As soon as the servant had left the
room, he came again to his mother with,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mamma, I know my lesson now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What do p-i-n make?” said the lady.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Pin</i>,” replied Eddy; for which correct
answer he received a smile and a quiet “That’s
right.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And what do p-i-n-e make?” continued his
mother.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Needle!</i>” shouted out the child with decision.
Mrs. Ellerslie laid the book down on her
knee. “I’m afraid that I must turn you again,
Eddy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eddy pouted as he took back his lesson, and
before Mrs. Ellerslie resumed her accounts, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>said to Lily, “Let me see how you are getting
on with your work.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Lily brought it reluctantly to her mother.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh fie! this will never do! Are you not
ashamed of such hemming?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I couldn’t lay down the hem right,” said
Lily very dolefully.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Could not, or would not, Lily? I am sure
that you can work more neatly than that. Just
take it back and unpick it nicely.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Lily coloured, and as she bent over me again,
I saw a big tear fall close beside me.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Three and eight, nine and four,” murmured
Mrs. Ellerslie over her accounts. “Lily, hold
up your head; you must not stoop so my
child. Eddy, do not pull off your buttons.”
She leaned her head upon her hand. I believe
that it was aching, and so Lily would have suspected
had she looked at that pale face; but
the young lady was gloomily proceeding with
her work, and perhaps grumbling in her heart
at the little task which she might so easily
have performed.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was clear to me that the poor mother was
to have no peace, for again she was interrupted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>to pay the washerwoman, and had scarcely
finished that small piece of business, rendered
troublesome by not having enough of change,
when there was a sound of crying from the
room above.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is not that baby’s voice?” exclaimed Mrs.
Ellerslie, half rising from her seat. She glanced
at Lily, probably intending to send her on a
message—at least it appeared so from the
movement of her head; but Lily had no idea
of reading the wishes of her mother, and kept
sullenly pricking me in and out, sitting as if
fastened to her seat. Mrs. Ellerslie, therefore,
took the shortest way of settling the matter,
and herself ran upstairs to the baby.</p>

<p class='c006'>Master Eddy took advantage of her absence
to clamber up her vacant chair, and make himself
acquainted with the contents of her desk.
A very little care on the part of Lily might
have prevented him from doing any mischief;
but, whether from ill-temper or inattention, she
took no notice whatever of his pranks. When
Mrs. Ellerslie re-entered the room, she found
her ink-bottle overturned on the table, and a
black stream flowing down on the carpet, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>her little boy was attempting to stop with a
handful of bills.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Eddy, Eddy, what have you done!”
cried the poor lady. “Lily, run quickly and
call down the housemaid. I cannot leave the
room for a minute,” she added, provoked beyond
even her powers of endurance, “but some
mischief is sure to occur.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mamma, I didn’t know there was ink in
the bottle—I only turned it up to see if
there was any; but I’m trying to wipe it
all up.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh dear! the bills!—and your hands and
pinafore; just see what a state they are in!
You must run up to Sarah directly!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll never do so any more!” cried Eddy,
looking at his blackened fingers, and beginning
to whimper.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the housemaid had performed her
office, and the children had been sent up to
prepare for their walk—happily the weather
was not rainy—the weary, delicate mother
again took her place before the table, and pushing
aside the blackened heaps of bills, which
she had now hardly a hope of being able to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>make out, she leaned back upon her chair and
sighed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The children are too much for me!” she
murmured to herself; “I really have not the
strength to do them justice. I must ask
Edward to let me have a governess. But no;
how could I think of such a thing, after the
hint which he gave me about expense, after his
parting with his own horse and gig, and giving
up the trip into Wales? He spoke, too, of the
expense of keeping George at school! I am sure
that there is something weighing upon his
mind; shall I add to it the burden of my petty
cares? No, no; whatever my dear husband finds
to annoy him in the busy, bustling world, he
must find his own home a quiet haven of rest.
I must manage as well as I can, and always have
a cheerful smile for him! One comfort is, that
George’s holidays are so near;—my own boy,
what a welcome he shall have!” and her lips
parted with a pleasant smile, and the lines upon
her pale brow quite disappeared, as if smoothed
down by an invisible hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This is odd enough!” thought I, as I lay
half out of the work-box, sticking in my unfortunate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>hem; “three children are more than
this poor lady can manage. I should have
thought that a fourth would have driven her
wild!”</p>

“I AM not very sorry,” observed I to the
Thimble, “that careless Miss Lily has
forgotten to replace our companion,
Mrs. Scissors, in the box. Her manners
are so sharp, her remarks so cutting,
that I take little pleasure in her society.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She has a little speck of rust on her, I
own,” quietly replied my philosophic friend;
“but we must all learn to bear patiently with
the weaknesses of others, and see that we keep
our own metal bright.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have no difficulty about that,” I observed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Pardon me,” answered the Thimble; “silver
is not subject to rust, but it tarnishes, especially
if exposed to impure, smoky air.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>“And was your origin as low as mine?” I
inquired; “were you also dug from the earth?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I was dug out of a mine in Norway; I
have been, like you, purified in a furnace, and
exposed to heavy blows of the hammer.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wonder how long it is,” exclaimed I,
“since man first found out the use of metals,
and employed them in making whatever he
requires!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The use of metals was known before the
time of the Flood, more than four thousand
years ago. Tubal-Cain is the name of the first
man who is recorded to have worked in metals.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh!” cried I, “how much I should like to
know who it was who first invented needles!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I dare say that the invention is of early
date,” replied the Thimble, “though the needles
of ancient times were probably far inferior to
the polished, delicate articles of which I see so
fine a specimen before me. I have heard that
needles were first manufactured in England by
an Indian, in the reign of stout Harry the
Eighth, upwards of three hundred years ago.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well,” I exclaimed in admiration, “what
it is to have a thimbleful of information! I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>shall always couple silver and knowledge together,
the best metal and the best thing in the
world!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, there you are wrong!” said my bright
companion; “there is a metal far more precious
than silver, and a possession even more valuable
than knowledge. What is learning compared
to virtue! what is silver compared to gold!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Gold! what is that?” said I. You must
remember that I was but a young needle, with
little information, but eager to obtain more.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Gold is what is called a perfect metal,”
replied the Thimble; “it is injured by neither
fire nor water, and it is reckoned of great value
in the world. It is found chiefly in South
America, California, and lately in the immense
island of Australia.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And has it to submit to the hammer as
well as we?” I inquired.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It has much more wonderful power of
enduring it than either silver or steel,” replied
the Thimble. “It never breaks beneath the
heaviest stroke, but it spreads itself out beneath
it, and that to such an amazing extent that I
have heard that a bit of gold not so large as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>halfpenny can be beaten out into a wire a
thousand miles long.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I was not a little astonished to hear this, and
I was still more so as the Thimble proceeded.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Look around you, and, even in this room,
you will see wonderful proofs of the malleability
of gold—that is the name given to this curious
property which it possesses. See the picture-frames
glittering in the light, the shining
pattern on the paper on the wall, the edge of
all those gaily bound books; they owe their
beauty to a layer of gold so thin that, though
that metal is one of the heaviest known, the
gentlest sigh would have blown the leaves
away.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And is gold useful for anything but gilding?”
said I.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is much used in various ways,” she replied;
“amongst others, it was formerly much
employed in medicine, and is now used in giving
a fine red colour to glass.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And is this beautiful and wonderful metal
also dug out of the earth?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is procured in some places,” answered the
Thimble, “by washing carefully sand drawn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>from the beds of some rivers, which is mixed
with particles of gold; but it is chiefly found
by digging.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, then,” cried I, rather triumphantly,
“though silver and gold be both esteemed more
perfect and more precious than iron and steel,
man would have very little chance of gaining
either of them without the help of a humbler
metal! If silver be like knowledge, and virtue
like gold, to what shall iron be compared.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“To firm resolution,” said the Thimble
thoughtfully, “without which man would acquire
little of either.”</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <br />A PIECE OF MISCHIEF.</h2>
</div>
<div class='c010'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di-t.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
THE next day I found that the lesson of
work was to be omitted. Little Miss
Lizzie Baker came to spend the day
with my young mistress, who was,
therefore, excused from performing her tasks;
which, I could not help imagining, would be
felt quite as great a relief by the teacher as by
the pupil.</p>

<p class='c006'>I was not, however, to be left in complete
idleness. Mrs. Ellerslie entered the sitting-room
in which the work-box of her daughter
was kept. She was dressed in her bonnet and
shawl; and seeing me close at hand, sticking
in Lily’s piece of work, she threaded me with
a piece of dark silk, and mended a small hole
in her glove. There was a great sound over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>head, as of little feet running about, and now
and then a fretful cry from the baby. The
lady rose and opened the door, and then I
could plainly distinguish a voice speaking from
an upper room in the house.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Indeed, Miss Lily, I shall never get the
child to sleep if you make such a constant
noise. You’ve woke her up these three times
already!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Lily! Lily!” called her mother at the foot
of the stairs. Whether her call was heard by
the little lady I know not, it certainly was not
answered, and Mrs. Ellerslie had walked half-way
up to the nursery before I heard the servant
exclaiming in a sharp tone, “Now do you
be quiet, Miss Lily; don’t you hear that mistress
is calling you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You had better come to the drawing-room,
my darlings,” called the gentle mother, “and
then nurse can put poor baby to sleep. I am
obliged to go out to make purchases, and to
execute commissions for my sister; but I am
sure that you will be good and happy while I
am away; and do not be too noisy, my pets.”</p>

<p class='c006'>So Lily and Lizzie Baker, a plump, dark-eyed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>little girl, came into the room, and seated
themselves on an ottoman, near the table on
which my work-box was placed. Eddy followed,
jumping step by step down the stairs,
and trotting up to his sister, said, “Lily, won’t
you let me play with you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, we don’t want you here,” was the
reply; “we are going to have a quiet chat
together. Just you amuse yourself, and don’t
trouble us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The little fellow turned dolefully away, went
up to the window, and flattened his nose against
the pane, looking after his mother as she
crossed the street; soiled his finger by drawing
lines across the glass which he had dimmed
with his breath; then, tired of that diversion,
tried to pull off the little twists of wool which
formed the fringe of the curtain; and then
suddenly making up to the table, laid his exploring
hand on the work-box.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There now, Eddy, you tormenting boy,
just take your hands off,” cried Lily, turning
round just in time to prevent its contents being
scattered on the floor. She roughly snatched
the box from the child, and giving him something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>very much like a shake, sent him half
crying to another end of the room.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He is the most mischievous little monkey,”
she said to her companion; “would you believe
it, he pulled off the wig of my new doll!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think that brothers are great torments,”
observed Lizzie.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, not such brothers as George,” replied
Lily; “he is always like sunshine in the house.
I am so glad that he is coming from school. I
have been counting the days to the holidays.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, that’s odd,” said Lizzie; “I always
dread them. In the morning of the day when
our boys return, I always think as soon as
I awake, ‘Dear, dear, we’ll have no more peace
in the house!’ They are so noisy, so rude, so
troublesome, so fond of worrying and teasing us
girls, I’m sure that it’s a happy day for us when
the coach comes to take them back to school.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They must be very different from George.
I always am happier when he is with me; and
it seems as if he made me better too.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But he cannot amuse himself with you.
Does he not like hocky, and cricket, and football,
and despise the diversions of girls?”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>“He does like cricket, and that sort of thing,
and is a capital hand at it too, but he does not
despise playing with us. I do not think that
he despises anything but what is mean or
wrong. You don’t know how fond little baby
is of him; and as for Eddy, he is never so
merry as when he is at romps with Georgie, or
listening to one of his stories. I don’t know
how it is, but every one seems more happy, and
everything looks brighter, when Georgie is at
home.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A funny fancy came into my head at this
moment. I could not help recollecting what
the Thimble had told me about gold—how that
metal, which is so weighty and precious, yet
can be spread into leaves so thin as to brighten
the paper on the wall and adorn the leaves of
the book. I wondered if there were anything
like this to be found in human life; if the
precious thing called virtue, which my companion
had likened to gold, could also be found
to extend to trifles, and in the smaller occurrences
of life show its power to brighten and
adorn. It was an odd idea, but it arose from
what I heard Lily say that morning of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>brother; and when I had an opportunity of
watching George myself, it recurred to me
again and again.</p>

<p class='c006'>So the young ladies sat there chatting and
diverting themselves for an hour or more, playing
at cat’s-cradle, comparing their dolls, telling
stories of the past, and building castles in the
air for the future. Eddy more than once broke
in on their <i>tête-à-tête</i>, but was told to go away,
and not disturb them. Driven to his own
resources, the child rode round the room on a
footstool; but this amusement was stopped, as
being too noisy. He then kicked his heels for
some time on the sofa, till, finding the occupation
tiresome, he made the discovery of a little
hole in a cushion, from which he managed to
abstract several tiny feathers, which amused
him for a quarter of an hour. Then I watched
him—for no eye seemed to watch him but mine—when
he wearily sauntered to the other side
of the room, and fixed his round eyes upon an
instrument which, as I have since learned, is
called a thermometer. He stared up at this,
till his curiosity grew strong. He dragged,
with some labour, a chair to the spot, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>scrambling up upon the seat, brought his face
to a level with the glass. He put out his hand
and touched the round ball at the bottom of the
instrument, examining it like any little philosopher;
he then pressed it a little harder, I
suppose, for I saw the child give a slight start,
as if some mischief had been done, and then
scramble from the chair faster than he had got
up, and throw himself down on the floor.</p>

<p class='c006'>Glancing up at the thermometer, I could see
that the little silver ball had disappeared; but
I was at a loss to account for Eddy’s movements
now, as, half-stretched on the carpet,
leaning on one elbow, he seemed to be attempting
to pick up something which eluded his grasp,
pouncing down his hand now here, now there,
and laughing to himself merrily all the while.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think it’s alive,” he said softly; “how
funnily it runs about when I try to get hold of
it!” and opening his mouth, he stooped closer
to the ground, as though to draw up with his
lips the something which always slipped from
his fingers. He was startled by a frightened
exclamation from his mother, who at this moment
entered the room.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“Eddy, my child! oh, don’t touch that! it’s
quicksilver—poison—it might kill you! Oh,
what a mercy that I came just in time!” and
weary, agitated, and alarmed, the poor lady
drew him close to her bosom and wept.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mamma!” exclaimed the child, frightened
at her tears, “I didn’t mean—I didn’t know—it
looked so funny; I never will do so any
more!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Lily, Lily!” cried Mrs. Ellerslie, with
something of bitterness in her tone, as both the
little girls hurried to her side, “could you not
have looked a little after your brother? If I
had returned but one minute later your carelessness
might have cost the life of my child!”</p>

  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di-w.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
“WHAT was that extraordinary metal,”
cried I, “which I took for a ball of
silver, till I saw the drops running
about on the carpet?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ha! ha!” laughed the spiteful
old Scissors, which, speck of rust and all, had
been replaced in the box, “you never saw the
solemn philosopher, Mrs. Thimble, ever cutting
a dance like that!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The lady called it quicksilver,” I observed.
“Was it, then, no relation of my friend?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Relation!” again exclaimed the Scissors;
“a relation that would eat her, rim, top, and
all; make holes for her knowledge to run out
of! Quicksilver is a dangerous neighbour.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dangerous both to metal and to man,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>quietly rejoined my learned companion. “Its
power can dissolve both silver and gold; and to
the human species it acts as a powerful poison.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wonder that they do not leave it alone,
if it does such mischief,” said I.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you not know,” replied my friend, “that
reason and knowledge can find valuable uses
even in those things which at first sight appear
only hurtful? From quicksilver, also called
mercury, a medicine is prepared, which, under
the name of calomel, has helped to preserve
many a life.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How strange!” I exclaimed; “medicine
and poison, safety and danger, both from the
same curious metal! But is it always a liquid
like that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh no!” replied the Thimble; “mixed
with other metals, it becomes staid and quiet
enough. Look at that beautiful mirror in the
gilded frame, which reflects every object in the
room. To what, think you, does it owe its
beauty? To an amalgam (that is the title
given to the mixture)—an amalgam of mercury
and tin, which lines the glass at the back.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And makes it a pretty aid to vanity and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>folly,” said the broken-pointed Scissors, with
bitterness. “If there is one thing which silly
mortals like better than another, it is to look
at their own faces in a glass.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If mercury has often ministered to vanity
and folly,” said the Thimble, “I remember
hearing of one curious instance where it served
to mortify them both. A dashing lady, who
was absurd enough to try to increase her beauty
by covering her yellow complexion with a delicate
coating of white paint, once visited a quicksilver
mine. She must have felt it strange to
find herself in that gloomy place, where the
sickly miners, by the glare of torch-light, pursue
their unwholesome occupation.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why should it be unwholesome?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Because mercury is of that poisonous nature,
that it is said that those employed to procure
it seldom live longer than two years in the
mine.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I should think that after learning that,”
observed I, “the dashing lady would have a
feeling of pain when next she looked in a
mirror.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Probably she had,” replied the Thimble,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>“but from a different cause. While she had
been examining the mine, she little thought of
the strange effect which the mercury would
have on the paint which covered her face.
She entered the place white like a lily; she
left it black like a negro!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The idea of the poor lady with her black
face mightily tickled the fancy of the Scissors,
who wished that she had been there to see her.
But my curiosity about the strange metal mercury
was not quite satisfied yet.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What was the use of that instrument hung
on the wall, where the quicksilver lay in its
little glass ball, till Master Eddy broke its prison
and set it free?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That instrument is called a thermometer.
It is employed to measure the heat of the
weather.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I cannot imagine how it can do that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is the nature of mercury to expand—that
is, grow bigger—whenever it is exposed to
heat. At the top of the glass ball there is a
slender glass tube. When the weather is warm,
the mercury swells; and the ball being too
small to hold it, it is forced up the tube to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>greater or less height, according to the amount
of the heat.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then, if plunged into boiling water, the
mercury would rise very high indeed.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And plunged into ice it would sink very
low.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Would it ever squeeze itself down into a
solid?” said I.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You mean, would it freeze as water does?
It requires very, very intense cold to freeze
mercury; but it is not impossible to do it. I
have heard the master of the shop in which I
lay unsold for years, who was himself something
of a philosopher, and from whose conversation
with others I have learned the little that I
know,—I have heard him say that he has seen
quicksilver frozen quite hard, so that even a
medal was made of it; but it was not from the
mere effect of winter weather.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And, of course, if any one had put the
medal into his warm pocket, it would have begun
to run about again directly. The best
way to keep it quiet seems to be to make an
am—— What did you call its mixture with
some other metal?”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>“Amalgam,” replied the Thimble.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, yes! behind the mirror is an amalgam
of quicksilver and tin.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Like energy united with common sense.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And taught to <i>reflect</i>,” added the Scissors.</p>

  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di-t.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
THE next day’s lessons passed over with
the usual amount of weariness on the
part of the teacher, dulness on that of
little Eddy, and carelessness on that
of his sister. It was with great difficulty
that Mrs. Ellerslie could keep the attention
of Lily to the tasks which she had to
learn. The thoughts of the little girl were
constantly wandering, now to her brother, now
to her play, now to some project in her mind,
while she tried the patience of her mother
almost as much by the numerous little bad
habits which seemed to spring up like weeds in
neglected ground.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Lily, do hold up your head!—My child,
you must not stand upon one foot!—Little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>girls ought not to bite their lips!—What! you
have been at your nails again!” Such were
the sentences which, from the lips of the anxious
parent, constantly interrupted the course of the
studies. I began to wonder whether little girls
could find any peculiar enjoyment in biting
their finger-ends—whether they thought it becoming
to look hunchbacked, or merely delighted
in teasing their teachers, and defeating
the efforts of those who love them to make
them lady-like and agreeable. As I am a needle,
and not a little girl, I cannot tell which of
these three motives it was that influenced the
conduct of Lily. If any of my young readers
ever follow her example, I beg them to decide
the question.</p>

<p class='c006'>At length lessons were finished, and the tired
teacher was free, but not to rest. Oh no! but
to pack up a box for her sister in India, which
must be despatched before one o’clock.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now, my darlings, run up and get ready
for your walk.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Lily sauntered slowly up to the window.
“Oh, I’m so glad! it’s raining fast!” said she.
“I have something that I particularly want to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>do. See, mamma, what Lizzie gave me yesterday!”
And she drew, from a little pocket in
her dress, a very small parcel, and opening it,
displayed to view a reel of bright, glittering
gold thread.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Very pretty; and what will you make of
it, my dear?” said Mrs. Ellerslie, kindly pausing
in her occupation of clearing away school-books
and slates, Lily never dreaming of offering
her assistance.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m going to ornament a pen-wiper for
George,” replied the child; “don’t you think
that it will please him very much? May I
stay here and work it beside you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Ellerslie nodded her head in assent, but
looked a little grave; perhaps she would have
preferred being left for an hour in quiet, and
had some idea what the permission would cost
her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And may I stay here too, mamma?” inquired
Eddy. “I want to look at you packing
all these things. Do let me stay, darling
mamma!”</p>

<p class='c006'>She could not resist his entreaty; so there
he pretty quietly stood, watching his mother as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>she hastily spread the table with various parcels,
brown paper, oil-skin, a tin box, and string.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mamma,” said Lily, standing on one foot,
with the golden thread dangling from her hand,
“don’t you think that this will look well upon
a dark ground?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, my love,” answered Mrs. Ellerslie, her
voice half drowned in the rustling of paper.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mamma, do you think blue or green would
look best?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I really cannot think about it at all just
now. My box must be ready before one.
Now, my Eddy, you must not open the parcels.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I was just peeping in a little, mamma.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t come to the table, my sweet boy!
Mamma is very busy indeed.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eddy trotted off without saying another
word.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mamma,” began Lily again, “do you think
that you have a bit of dark-blue cloth or velvet,
whichever you please, to give me for the sides
of my pen-wiper?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I dare say I have some upstairs in my
wardrobe.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Could I go and get it, mamma?”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>“No; you know that I never allow you to
search there,” said the lady, who, having lined
the bright tin box with paper, was trying every
possible position in which an awkward shaped
parcel could take up least room.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lily remained silent for a few minutes, but
without occupying herself with anything but
the thought how she could persuade her mother
to give her at once what she had set her heart
upon obtaining. At length she cautiously commenced
with, “I am rather in a hurry to
begin.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will look out the piece for you when
next I go upstairs.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Lily gave a very audible sigh.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This would be just the time for working,”
murmured she.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I shall have no peace till I get it for the
child,” exclaimed Mrs. Ellerslie, half to herself;
and the too indulgent mother left her parcels
and her box, to commence a search for some
small remnants of cloth, which, to judge by the
length of her absence, she had a good deal of
trouble in finding.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now, do not interrupt me any more,” she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>said, as she placed them in the eager hand of
Lily, and turned, by more active exertions, to
make up for the time which she had lost.</p>

<p class='c006'>The girl bore them off in triumph to her
work-box; but here a new difficulty arose.
She snipped off this corner and that corner, by
the aid of Mrs. Scissors, but could not satisfy
herself with the shape. Again she approached
her mother at the table: “Please to make me
a good round, mamma. I have tried, but I
cannot do it myself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You can wait a little, my dear.” Mrs.
Ellerslie was pressing down the lid of the box,
which seemed evidently determined not to close,
and she looked certainly heated and tired.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again I heard that naughty, impatient sigh;
again the tender mother yielded to importunity;
the round was cut out, and a minute’s peace
secured.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where’s the string?” said Mrs. Ellerslie
quickly, moving the box, lifting paper, glancing
under the table. The lines on her forehead
were plain enough now.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lily was busily employed trying to force the
bright golden thread though my little eye. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>saw plainly that she could never succeed, and
I felt exceedingly mortified; for what could be
a higher object of ambition to a needle than to
be threaded with gold? Lily saw that her
mother was hunting and searching for the lost
piece of string, but she never stirred to assist
her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where can it be? I’m sure that I brought
some down! Where can I have laid the
string?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here it is!” cried Eddy, suddenly becoming
aware that his mother wanted something which
he had himself carried off. He had been quietly
amusing himself in his corner, tying chairs,
stool, sofa, and bell-rope together, with a liberal
expenditure of string and a very large allowance
of tight knots.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was Mrs. Ellerslie’s turn to be impatient,
as, hastily endeavouring to undo the child’s
work, she exclaimed, “How on earth shall I
unfasten all this?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s my harness, mamma, and these are my
horses! Oh, are you vexed?” he added, looking
up in her face, and reading, from her
harassed expression, that he had again been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>guilty of causing her trouble. “I’m very sorry,
mamma; I’ll never do so any more.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Even in the midst of her hurry, the gentle
mother stooped down to give him a kiss. She
had another hurried run upstairs to bring more
string, for she had not the spare time to undo
all his knots; but no angry word passed her
lips. She let Eddy stand beside her at the
table, even trusted him to hold a match which
she had lighted, and employed him to ring the
bell.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am so glad that it is done at last!”
cried the lady, sinking wearily on the sofa, as
the box—it was barely packed in time—was
carried by a servant from the room.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And I helped you, mamma!” said Eddy
proudly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I shall never manage this!” cried Lily impatiently.
“Oh, the tiresome needle!—stupid
thread!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am at leisure now,” said her mother;
“bring your work to me, my dear child.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“One would need a bodkin to hold such
great coarse cord,” exclaimed Lily.</p>

<p class='c006'>What a name to give to the most delicate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>flexible thread which had ever employed the
ingenuity of man to beat out from a single
grain of gold!</p>

<p class='c006'>“If you had waited a little, I should have
shown you what to do. The gold thread must
not be passed through the thick cloth at all,
but be fastened down to it with a little fine
cotton. Thread your needle, and I will show
you the way.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Oh, the patience and love of a mother! Alas,
that it should often be met, if not with actual
ingratitude, yet with that selfish want of consideration
which receives every kindness as a
matter of course, and never makes the smallest
sacrifice in return!</p>

“OF what a fine bright metal that box is
made,” said I; “I should almost
have taken it for silver.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Your learned friend here would
be shocked to be mentioned in the
same breath with tin!” observed the Scissors.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Far from it,” said the bright silver Thimble.
“If usefulness to man gives value to metal, few
can rank more highly than tin. England owes
to it her earliest fame; for long before her flag
waved o’er distant seas—long before her conquering
armies trod foreign shores, while her
fields were wild forests, and her people barbarians,
the Phœnicians sought her coasts for
tin, for which her mines in Cornwall are yet
famous.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>“Ah! I remember,” I observed, “that it is
when mixed with tin that mercury forms the
amalgam used for the backs of mirrors.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mercury is not the only metal which unites
in a friendly manner with tin. Joined to
copper, it becomes bronze, of which those pretty
chimney-piece ornaments are made; and pewter,
so useful to the poor, comes from tin united
with lead. It is also very commonly used to
line copper pots and pans, which, without such
a coating of tin, might poison the food which
they contain.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Poison!” I exclaimed in surprise.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes; many serious accidents have arisen
from the tin lining wearing away from cooking
vessels made of copper. The rust of copper is
called verdigris; it is of a bright green colour,
and of a most poisonous nature.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah!” said the Scissors, “that accounts for
our good lady’s alarm, when she found one
morning, about two years ago, Master Eddy
sucking a copper halfpenny! A precious deal
of trouble that young gentleman has given
her. He’s as active as quicksilver, and as mischievous.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“Pity that we can’t make an amalgam of
him,” laughed I, “and teach the little rogue to
reflect.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He, Miss Lily, and the baby are killing
their mother by inches between them,” said the
Scissors.</p>

<p class='c006'>I felt rather afraid that she spoke truth,
when I saw how faint and exhausted the poor
lady appeared, when at length she found a few
minutes for repose. She looked so very thin
and so pale, as she stretched herself on the sofa,
when the light of day began to grow dim.
She opened a book with gilt edges, which I had
observed to be her favourite companion, and
which my friend had told me was, as she believed,
a great mine from which man drew all
the virtue which he possessed. She read a
little, until her worn, anxious face assumed a
peaceful expression. She raised her eyes, and
looked upwards; I thought that they were
moistened with tears; and her pale lips silently
moved, as if she were speaking to some unseen
friend. Then she shut the book, and placed it
beside her, and her blue eyes languidly closed;
and she lay so still, so very still, that she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>looked as though she never would move
again.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sound of the opening of the outer door
seemed to awaken her in a moment. She
started up with quite a changed look, so bright,
so animated, so cheerful; passed her hand
hastily over her hair to smooth it, and then
ran out of the room: and I heard her voice
below in lively tones giving a fond welcome to
her husband.</p>

<p class='c006'>It must have been difficult, however, for the
poor lady to keep up a cheerful manner in his
presence. I never saw so gloomy a man. It
was in vain that she troubled him not with a
single care of her own,—that she spoke not a
word of her failing health, her difficulties with
servants, her troubles about the bills, her ceaseless
anxieties with the children. I watched
him where I lay beside my thread of gold; for
Lily’s habit of filling her box so full that she
never even attempted to close it, gave me constant
opportunities of looking about me, and
seeing what passed in the room. When the
children were called down to see their father,
the stern gloom in his face never changed. Even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>when his wife placed little Rosey in his arms,
he kissed her soft cheek with an air so sad,
that the babe, half frightened, held out her
hands to be taken back to her mother. Lily
could not win his attention at all, and left the
room mortified and vexed; and Eddy received
no answer when he said, “Are you not glad
that Georgie is coming home to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m sure that there’s something the matter
with that man,” said the Thimble, when the
sound of the dinner-bell had cleared the room.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There’s something weighing on his heart,
you may be sure,” observed the Scissors, “for
he used to be as merry as a child. I’ve seen
him galloping up and down this very room,
with Master Eddy perched upon his shoulders,
and Lily scampering at his heels; and it would
have puzzled even our sharp friend the Needle
to say which was the liveliest of the three.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He’s in trouble, then,” said the Thimble:
“I’ve seen enough of life to know that mortals
have their trials, which are to them as the
hammer and the furnace to us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The opinion of our philosophic friend was
confirmed that evening, as, when the lamp was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>lighted, and the curtains drawn, and the children
all quiet in bed, the husband and wife sat
together in deep, earnest conversation.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You will hide nothing from me, my beloved,”
said the lady, laying her hand fondly
on his, and looking anxiously into his face.
“I have felt for a long time that something
was wrong; suspense is worse than the truth
could be. I can bear all, all but to see you
unhappy, and not be able to lighten, or at least
share your trials!”</p>

<p class='c006'>He drew her closer to him. I could not see
his face; it was turned from the place where I
lay; and he spoke so low, in a hoarse, agitated
voice, that I could catch but few of his words.
They were such as “ruin,” “bankruptcy,”
“poverty;” the meaning of which I could
scarcely comprehend; but I saw the lady’s
cheek grow very pale, though her manner was
quiet and composed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, dearest,” she said softly at length,
“there are far greater trials than poverty. It
will only draw us closer together. I can be
happy in a very small abode—a cabin, a hut—so
that my dear husband and children are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>with me. I will be Rosey’s nurse myself.
We can manage on little; so little, you shall
see what a housewife I shall be!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah!” thought I, as I looked on that sweet
loving face, “the gold indeed looks brightest
on the dark ground, and virtue most lovely in
affliction.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It may not come to that; all may yet be
well,” said the husband, rising and pacing up
and down the room. “If I only could meet
the present difficulty! A loan at this time
would keep us all afloat; one good friend at
this crisis might save us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“George Hardcastle,” suggested the lady.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have thought of him a thousand times,”
replied her husband, stopping in his agitated
walk. “He is rolling in wealth; he is generous;
he is our cousin; our boy was named
after him. But then—” He paused, and
looked at his wife.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We have quarrelled with him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>I</i> have quarrelled with him. We have not
met for months. I could not stoop to write to
him now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not for your children’s sake?” said the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>mother, rising and laying her hand on his arm.
“Oh, Edward, we must think of our helpless
babes! Even if he refused to lend money to
you, he might, I think that he would, do something
for our George.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Ellerslie uttered a sigh that was almost
a groan, and threw himself down on his chair.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It seems to me as though we should lose
no time,” continued his anxious wife; “so
much is at stake! Let’s see: this is Wednesday,”
she continued, pressing her hand on her
forehead. “I think there are two posts to
Bristol; if we wrote at once, we might have
an answer on Friday. Edward, when all depends
on it, why should there be one hour’s
delay?”</p>

<p class='c006'>I could see that it went sorely against the
will of Mr. Ellerslie to yield to the persuasions
of his wife. It seemed to me, from words that
dropped from him, that he was conscious of
having behaved ill towards his cousin; that he
regarded Mr. Hardcastle with a feeling of dislike,
and almost preferred remaining in difficulties
to asking assistance from him. I saw,
though no mortal ever saw it, that Mrs. Ellerslie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>had a good deal to endure from her husband,
however dear she might be to his heart. What
patience she required, what earnest persuasion,
to induce his proud spirit to bend so far as to
write at all to his offended relative! And then,
when the desk was opened, what a painful task
was hers to make him write what would not
offend, to alter sentences and soften expressions,
and stoop to explain the greatness of his need.
Often the ink dried on the pen, twice was the
half-written sheet pushed angrily away, and
bitter things were uttered, even to her whose
every look and every tone was love. I scarcely
believed that the letter would ever be finished.
But finished it was at last; and Mr. Ellerslie
hastily quitted the room, impatient with his
wife, with himself, with all the world!</p>

<p class='c006'>The lady took the sealed letter in her tremulous
grasp, folded her hands, and again looked
upwards: again her lips moved; and this time
the big tears rolled slowly down her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We must do all that we can,” she faintly
murmured to herself. “The hearts of men are
in His hands. We must leave no proper means
untried, and then commit all to a higher Power.”</p>

  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di-c.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
CONSIDERING the heavy weight of
care which I knew lay on the heart
of the lady, it was wonderful to me
how quietly she went through the
ceaseless petty trials of her life.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lily and Eddy came as usual to their lessons
next morning, the former with her dress a good
deal torn.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Please, mamma, nurse says that I want a
new frock.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is not long since I purchased this, Lily.
You must have treated it very carelessly indeed,”
replied the mother, looking somewhat grave.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, it’s poor stuff!” cried Lily, giving a
little pull, which confirmed her assertion, by
making the rent a good deal wider.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>“There is no use in making it worse, Lily.
I cannot afford to be buying new clothes. We
must do the best we can with the old.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nurse says that she has no time for mending.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think that these lazy little fingers might
make themselves useful,” said Mrs. Ellerslie,
with a gentle smile; “those who mar things
ought at least to mend them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I cannot mend such a frock!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then <i>I</i> must,” said the lady.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lily glanced at her mother’s face for a
moment; perhaps she saw something there
that pricked her conscience a little, for she said
in an altered tone, “Dear mamma, I should
like to be useful, but I do not like mending at
all!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nor do I, my love,” answered her mother.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was nothing more said on the subject
at that time. The lessons proceeded as usual.
Lily, whose thoughts were very full of the expected
arrival of her brother, broke off several
times in the midst of her tasks, when she heard
the sound of a carriage, and rushed to the window,
whither she always was followed by Eddy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>though assured each time that it was impossible
that George could arrive till after early dinner.</p>

<p class='c006'>If Lily had known all that I knew, I cannot
but think that for once she would have shown
some consideration for the teacher, whose mind
was so full of troubles and cares; I cannot but
think that she would have known her verse
correctly, held up her head, and kept her
finger-ends still; but, as it was, the old story
was repeated again, and when lesson-time was
over, the child did not even seem conscious that
she had been doing anything wrong!</p>

<p class='c006'>But oh! the bustle and commotion that
there were when a cab, with a black trunk on
the coachman’s box, did at length actually
drive up to the door! The whole house resounded
with the cry, “It is George! it is
George! he has come!” I heard little Eddy
swinging himself downstairs so fast, that it
must have been at the peril of his neck; I believe
the coachman had not even time to ring,
so eagerly the door was opened; and there was
such a medley of eager voices in the hall, that
all the neighbourhood must have known of the
arrival! I soon saw Mrs. Ellerslie enter the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>drawing-room, with a colour on her cheek and
a sparkle in her eye; her arm was round the
neck of her son, and she surveyed him with
mingled pride and joy!</p>

<p class='c006'>I shall not attempt to repeat the conversation
which passed; every one seemed so eager
to ask questions, that there was scarcely a
possibility of reply; but I noticed that whenever
his mother spoke, George was instantly
silent and attentive; and that though he
laughed, played, and chatted merrily with
all, his eye most frequently rested on her.
Then he had to go upstairs to see the baby,
followed, of course, by Lily and Eddy, who
pursued him like his shadow; and it was not
till an hour or two afterwards that he re-entered
the drawing-room with them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And now, Georgie, you must show us your
prize!” cried Lily, with eager pleasure.</p>

<p class='c006'>They sat down on the ottoman together,
just as Lizzie and Lily had sat, and Eddy
crept up close to his brother. This time no
one sent him away.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A book! what a beauty!” cried Lily; but
on turning over some of the pages, she added,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>with a look of disappointment, “But what a
stupid book it must be! all about metals, and
things no one cares for!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I’ve been reading a little in the train,
and I do not find it stupid at all. It tells one
so much that is curious and new. Did you
ever hear, Eddy, of metal spoons that would
melt in hot tea like sugar?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eddy opened his eyes very wide.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, men really make such spoons—I mean,
that they would, if they thought that any one
would buy them—of a mixture of bismuth, lead,
and tin!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I never heard of bismuth before,” cried
Lily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is a white metal, of a reddish-yellow
tinge, used with others in making solder for
the plumbers. There’s the beauty of my book,
Lily; it tells one so much that one never heard
of before. Did you know that there was a
wine made of steel?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Steel wine? Oh yes! that is what mamma
has to take every day, to make her strong. But
it is not at all nice; it does not taste in the
least like other wine.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>“Then there’s sugar of lead.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’d like that!” cried Eddy, smacking his
lips at the idea of a sweetmeat.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Would you, my little man? But it would
not like you. Sugar of lead is that metal
dissolved in spirit of vinegar; and that, you
must know, makes it a poison.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well,” said Lily, “I always considered
lead as a dull, heavy metal, fit for nothing but
making water-pipes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“My book would tell you a different tale.
Why, you forget black lead pencils, and the
types used in printing. It is employed also in
making clear glass, the varnish on china, and
beautiful white paint, for all that it looks so
dull! Then, it’s so odd to think that from
mixing some metals together you can get quite
a new one! Look at the bright brass rods
upon which the curtains are hung; brass is a
mixture of copper and zinc.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They look like gold!” cried Eddy, looking
up. “What do people mix to make gold?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You funny little philosopher,” said George,
playfully tapping his brother on the cheek,
“that’s the very question which for ages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>puzzled the brains of the learned. They
wanted to discover some way to mix up metals
and make gold. Even the wonderful Sir Isaac
Newton was very anxious to find it out! Men
were always searching and searching for what
they called ‘the philosopher’s stone;’ and they
read old books, and looked at the stars, as if
they could see the secret written there; and
they kept up fires for years and years, and
mixed together all sorts of things; and some
spent all their money, and some all their lives,
in trying to find out how to make gold!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And never found out at last?” inquired
Lily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It was like running after a rainbow, that
searching for the philosopher’s stone. But
look at Eddy; he is yawning. He is not quite
a Sir Isaac Newton yet; so I think, Lily, that
we had best shut the book, and be off for a
game at hide-and-seek!”</p>

“YOU won’t do any lessons, George, during
the holidays, I suppose?” said
Lily, as she slowly and reluctantly
brought her lesson-books to her
mother the next day.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s as mamma likes,” answered George.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think,” said Mrs. Ellerslie, replying to
his glance, “that as you have been working so
hard, my boy, you might indulge in a few
days’ complete rest.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I must not be quite idle,” said George
cheerfully; “will you not let me teach Eddy
while I am at home?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think that you would be soon tired of
the business,” replied Mrs. Ellerslie, with a
smile.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>“I’ll try my skill as a tutor, at least;” and
there was a bright look about the boy, which
seemed to say, “I am determined <i>not</i> to be
tired.”</p>

<p class='c006'>So George set about the task of tuition with
wondrous good-humour and patience; and
Eddy was delighted with his teacher, who
really succeeded in persuading him at last that
twice two does <i>not</i> make three. I must own
that Eddy persisted to the end in calling <i>no</i>—<i>on</i>,
and <i>of</i>—<i>for</i>; but then he was but a little
boy, and George said that he would do better
in time. It was certainly a relief to Mrs.
Ellerslie not to have her attention diverted
from Lily; but I could not but fancy, from the
anxious, abstracted expression of the poor lady’s
face, that her own thoughts were often wandering
from the lessons to the difficulties of her
husband and the expected letter from Bristol.</p>

<p class='c006'>As soon as the studies were over she quitted
the room, doubtless glad that the drudgery was
ended for the day; and merry as a bird from
a cage, Lily flew to the side of her brother.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s raining, so we need not go out. Oh,
what a delightful chat we shall have! Just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>sit down beside me, Georgie, and tell me how
you feel now that you are at home.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I should feel very happy indeed, but that
I think mother is looking very ill.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you?” exclaimed Lily, with a look of
alarm. “Well, I hoped that she was better,
for she never complains. The doctor saw her
about a month ago; he gave her something to
strengthen her, and said that she must be
taken care of, and then there would be nothing
to fear.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And is she taken care of?” said George.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I don’t know—I don’t see what we
can do,” replied Lily, looking perplexed; “I
would gladly sit up all night, if it could do her
any good.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She does not want any one to sit up with
her all night,” said George; “but I cannot help
thinking that we could do more for her, Lily,
than the cleverest doctor could. The lessons
are a great fatigue to her, I fear.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I’m sure that I should be delighted
to leave them off, every one of them!” exclaimed
his sister.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That would not do,” answered George;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>“they must be learned; and I am afraid that
I could not teach you as well as Eddy. But
it does seem to me, Lily,” he continued, speaking
more slowly and looking on the ground,
“that you might save mother just half the
trouble that you give her at your lessons.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I! what do you mean?” said Lily quickly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, dear, I don’t wish to vex you; but
you know that I could not help hearing what
went on all the time that you were at your
tasks. Mother had to tell you this thing and
that—just what, I suppose, she had told you a
hundred times before: and you were watching
the butterfly fluttering about while she was
explaining the rule of three; so of course you
did not understand it one bit, and she had to
begin from the beginning again. Mother is so
kind and gentle—it seems as though her goodness
made you careless. I am sure that you
would learn your lessons much better if she had
taught you with a rod in her hand.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“George, I never expected this from you!”
cried Lily, her eyes filling with tears.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Forgive me, dear, for speaking so plainly;
but when I look at mother, and see her so thin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>and so pale, I can’t help telling you a little
what I think. Now, it’s just like this,” continued
George, searching in his mind for a
simile. “Suppose that you were lame, and
that it was my duty to lift you into the baby’s
little carriage, and give you a turn round the
square.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You could manage it, I dare say,” said Lily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah! but suppose that, as I was drawing
you along, you caught at every bush, and clung
to the palings, and held the wheels, so that they
could not be turned round.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Lily could not refrain from laughing. “You
would have hard work, Georgie, dragging me
along! But I should never make you so unkind
a return, if you were so good as to draw
me round the square!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And yet, when dear mother gives her time
and her strength to getting you on with your
learning, you act just as if you wished to make
her pull in vain; and I am sure that she is just
as much tired as I should be after giving such
a drive. Now, Lily, I am certain that you
love dear mamma—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I love her—I dote on her—I would do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>anything for her!” exclaimed the little girl,
fairly bursting into tears, for she was much
wounded by the words of her brother.</p>

<p class='c006'>George kissed her again and again, as if
angry with himself for having vexed her; but
as soon as Lily was more calm, he resumed the
subject once more.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now, dear, suppose that you and I resolve
in future to do our very best to make mother
strong and well. There are three things which
I think will do her more good than all the
steel wine in the world. First, let her never
say anything <i>twice</i>—what a saving of her
strength that would be! Then let us always
determine to think of her pleasure before our
own. And lastly, in every little thing, let us
save her all the trouble that we can. Oh, Lily,
let us only consider what a blessing God has
given us in such a parent; we cannot love her
too much, nor care for her too much, nor too
earnestly try to obey that commandment,
‘<i>Honour thy father and thy mother</i>.’ And
now, will you forgive me for what I have
said?” George added, gently laying his hand
upon his sister’s.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Lily threw her arms around his neck.
“George, you are a darling!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And so we will be merry again! Come,
dry up those eyes, dear Lily; I cannot bear
to see you cry.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Lily smiled through her tears, dried her
eyes, and then, taking her work-box from the
table, she drew out her beautiful pen-wiper.
“Can you guess for whom this is?” said she;
“do you think that it will be pretty when it
is done?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Very pretty indeed,” answered George; “how
beautiful the gold looks on the dark blue!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is for a certain brother of mine,” said
Lily, with an arch, pleasant smile.</p>

<p class='c006'>“For a brother who will value it very
much—I think that I can answer for that,”
replied George.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m going to work it now,” said the little
girl, as she passed a thread through my eye.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have you nothing else that you wish to
do first, dear Lily?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, nothing;—oh, you are looking at that
hole in my dress; but I never mend my own
clothes.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>“I thought that I heard mother say something
about that very hole to-day,” observed
George, with a little hesitation.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I suppose that I ought to run it up;
but I do so detest mending.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wish that I could help you, Lily; but
I fear that my fingers are too clumsy. Here
is an opportunity for you to begin to follow
up your good resolutions. Here is something
which you dislike to do; but then your doing
it will give pleasure to mother. What is trouble
to you will save trouble to her, and you will
be so glad when the effort is made.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Must I put this by?” said Lily, looking
sadly at her pen-wiper.</p>

<p class='c006'>“For a while, dear—only for a while. I
shall always look with more pleasure at my
beautiful present when I remember that my
Lily would not let her own will come before
her duty and her love to her mother.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The pen-wiper was replaced in the box, and
I felt myself hastily run into the dress.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will sit beside you while you work,”
said George, “and tell you a story to amuse
you.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>“A story! a story!” exclaimed Eddy, running
up to his brother in high glee at the
word.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Eddy! what have you been about?—pulling
the horse-hair out of the chair!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He is always at some mischief,” said Lily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think,” observed George, “that it must
be because he is idle, and cannot keep those
little fingers still. Now, Eddy, would you not
rather be a comfort to mamma, and help her?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do help mamma!” exclaimed the little
boy, with a look of injured innocence; “I helped
her a great deal to pack her box; I wish
mamma had a box to pack every day.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Perhaps mamma would not join in that
wish. But if there is not a box to pack, here
is a great skein of wool to wind. Will you
hold it on your hands, little man, while I try
to find out the knot?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He’ll let it slip off to a certainty!” cried
Lily; “you had much better put it over a
chair.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Will you let it slip off, Eddy,” said his
brother, “and spoil all the skein for mamma?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll hold it as tight—as tight as a drum!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>cried the child, indignant at his carefulness
being doubted. “I will be useful—I will help
mamma!” his face quite flushed as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’ll be her comfort, Eddy; I’m sure of
it,” said George. “Now, softly; you need not
stretch it so hard; just hold your hands a little
nearer to the light; I can wind all the time
that I am telling the story.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, how nice it will be! how happy we
are! What shall the story be about?” cried
Eddy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let me see,” said George, shaking out a
knot. “Why, Lily, how famously you are
getting on with your hole! We shall be puzzled
to find out the place where it was. I think
that, in compliment to your work, I will tell
you a story of a needle and a compass.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of a needle!—oh, what fun!” cried little
Eddy. A jovial little fellow he was, and very
merry sounded his laugh; but it was not merrier
than mine, if the children could have heard
it; for never had it entered my thoughts for a
moment that any one would ever make a story
about me; and I felt amazingly complimented
by the idea.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>“What sort of needle?” asked Eddy; “a big
needle—a darning needle—a bodkin?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh no!” replied George, with a smile;
“we need nothing so grand as that. We’ll
have a story of a nice little needle, just like
that with which Lily is sewing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>With eager curiosity I listened, and the
Scissors and the Thimble were all full of attention,
as George commenced his story.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <br />THE STORY OF A NEEDLE AND A COMPASS.</h2>
</div>
<div class='c010'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di-o.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
“ONCE upon a time, in the days of
fairies—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How long ago?” inquired Eddy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, you must not ask too particularly
about that,” laughed George;
“but I suppose that, as there is a compass in my
story, it must have been after the compass was
invented—about the thirteenth century, that
is to say, though some believe that the Chinese
had it more than two thousand years before.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But what is a compass?” said Eddy, looking
up.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Eddy,” cried Lily with impatience,
“you must not interrupt us every minute!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Poor little fellow! it is very natural that
he should like to understand,” observed George
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>“I’ll try to explain it to you, Eddy. There
is a strange substance, called loadstone, dug out
of the ground, for which iron has a wonderful
fancy. If a lump of it were placed in Lily’s
work-box, all her needles and scissors, and her
keys, if she had any, would jump to it, and
cling to it in a minute, just as you would jump
into mother’s arms.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, I wish that I had a lump as big as my
head! I should like to see the poker and the
tongs and the shovel all jumping!” exclaimed
Eddy, full of merriment at the thought.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And the odd thing is,” continued George,
“that when iron is well rubbed with this loadstone,
it seems as though it grew just like it,
for it gets the very same curious property of
attracting other bits of iron. One of the boys
at my school had a large steel magnet—that is,
steel that had been rubbed with the loadstone—and
it was the funniest thing in the world to
see a dozen needles sticking to it at once, like
so many quills upon a porcupine.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But what has this to do with the compass?”
inquired Lily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It has a great deal to do with the compass.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>It has been discovered that magnets,
when put in such a position that they can
freely move in any direction, are sure always
to turn towards the north: so little instruments
are formed, holding a small piece of steel
made into a magnet, not fixed, but left to
tremble and tremble, till, like a tiny finger, it
points towards the North Pole.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is the use of that?” said Eddy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is of wonderful use,” answered George.
“Why, only think of poor sailors at sea; when
there is nothing but water, wide water, around
them, and when the clouds hide the sun or the
stars, how can they tell which way to steer?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know,” said Eddy, quite puzzled.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They look at their clever little compass—they
see in what direction it points—they
know from it where the north and south lie;
and the tiny magnet serves as a guide.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What a clever little compass!” cried Eddy;
“now, please go on with your story.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, as I said, once upon a time, in a
beautiful garden, near a beautiful palace, there
sported two beautiful children. They were
the little son and daughter of a king; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>they were brought up with such foolish indulgence,
that in all things they had their own
way. They did not like spelling, so they
never learned to spell; they did not know their
tables; they never looked at maps; they could
not so much as count their fingers!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh!” exclaimed Eddy, “the stupid little
things!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They were not naturally more stupid than
others,” replied George; “but then they were
terribly idle. They were of no use to any one
in the world. They did nothing but gather
fruit and eat it, and make garlands of pretty
flowers, and sing aloud their foolish little song—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘I love to be idle, I love to be gay,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>I’ll throw my books and my work away;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>From morning till night—all play, all play!’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>There was a twinkle in Eddy’s merry eye
that seemed to say that he felt no surprise at
the idle taste of the children.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well,” continued George, winding rapidly
all the time that he spoke, “one day they were
playing together in the garden, when they were
surprised to hear a low, soft sound, which came
from a bed of flowers. They ran eagerly to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>the spot, and, standing in the cup of a tulip, a
fine tulip, all streaked with crimson and white,
what do you think they saw?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eddy suspected a wasp, or a dragon-fly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No; a lovely little fairy, with gossamer
wings, all spangled with silver and gold; and
she held in her hand a fine glittering wand, not
half so big as the tiniest needle!</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Oh, foolish children!’ she cried, in a soft,
sweet voice, which sounded like the tinkling of
a bell, ‘do you think life was made only for
a plaything, and time given to be thrown away
in folly! There is work in this world for
every one to do, and everything is created for
some use. As you have never, with your wills,
done any service to mankind, it is your doom
to do service without them. Your eyes, your
ears, your hands, your tongues, have been given
you to no purpose; their powers shall now be
taken quite away; for seven long years you
shall toil in humble estate, till you have learned
how great is the value of time, and opportunity
to do some good to others!’</p>

<p class='c006'>“While the little prince was wondering what
the fairy could mean, she stretched her gossamer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>wings, and flying towards him, she touched
him on the face with her wand. A very odd
feeling came over him at once. He seemed to
be contracting like an india-rubber ball, when
some one has let out the air. Feet and legs,
hands and arms, appeared drawn into his body;
and the body itself became smaller, and rounder,
and harder, every minute, till nothing was left
of the poor little prince but a mariner’s compass
in a neat brass case, with its slender finger
trembling, trembling, till it found its resting-place
towards the north!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eddy opened his blue eyes very wide at the
idea of such a strange transformation, and
nearly let the skein of wool slip over his
fingers.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The little girl stood amazed, as you may
suppose, at the singular change in her brother.
In her surprise to see him shrink into so curious
a shape, she was uttering a cry of dismay, when
her tongue, all on a sudden, ceased to move,
her fingers appeared fastened to her sides, her
feet joined together and grew into a point—she
shrank, shrank, as if going to disappear
altogether—till, where the little princess had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>stood, there only lay on the ground a small
needle!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, George, what a comical story!” cried
Lily, smoothing down the dress, which she now
had finished mending.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Please, go on,” exclaimed Eddy; “what
did the fairy do next?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Turning towards the mariner’s compass,
and waving her wand to the sound of strange
wild music in the air, she sang the following
words:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>‘Upon the stormy tide</div>
      <div class='line in13'>The weary seaman guide,</div>
      <div class='line'>And point to the North across the ocean wide!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Then bending over the needle, she continued
the lay—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>‘What is marred, make right;</div>
      <div class='line in13'>What is severed, unite;</div>
      <div class='line'>And leave where’er you pass a golden thread of light!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Then in what manner they were conveyed
away I know not, but suddenly the compass
found itself on the deck of a ship, and the
needle in the work-box of a young lady.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That was Lily,” suggested Eddy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh! as if we lived in the time of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>fairies!” exclaimed his sister, now busy again
with her pen-wiper.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, we may call industry and affection
good fairies,” said George, “for what wonderful
changes they make! But to go on with my
little story.</p>

<p class='c006'>“For seven long years the compass and the
needle were as clever and useful, and did as
much work, as compass and needle could do.
The one was tossed on the stormy sea, was
nearly lost in a shipwrecked vessel, and when
it was deserted by its crew, and almost everything
else left behind, they took it with them,
as something more precious than gold, and by
it were guided to safety! It were endless to
tell all the good deeds of the tiny needle in its
quiet little home; how many holes it mended,
how many poor it clothed, what beautiful pen-wipers
it made,” George added, glancing playfully
at his sister, “till at last—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, what happened at last?” said Eddy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“At last, one lovely summer morn, when all
the birds were singing, and the flowers smelling
sweet, and the trees waving softly in the air,
in the beautiful garden of a beautiful palace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>the two beautiful children found themselves
again, with their arms closely twined around
each other!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Had they not grown in all that time?”
inquired Lily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They had grown wiser, dear; but the
years that had passed seemed to them like
nothing but a dream; and a dream they would
have thought them, so exactly did everything
appear as it had done before, had not the same
silvery voice come from the centre of a rose,
and the same fairy form appeared with spangled
wings, and tiny glittering wand!</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Let not the lessons which you have
learned be forgotten!’ she cried. ‘Follow the
same path of usefulness now with your wills as
you have lately been doing without them.
Let not lifeless brass and steel do more than
beings with reason, judgment, and affection.
Let the heart still point to the pole-star of duty
in every danger and trouble; and your home
be cheered by the quiet virtues which adorn
the peace-maker, the comforter, the friend!’
Then bursting into song as she vanished into
air, the fairy’s musical voice was heard:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>‘On life’s ocean wide</div>
      <div class='line in13'>Your fellow-creatures guide,</div>
      <div class='line'>And point to a shore beyond the stormy tide!</div>
      <div class='line in13'>What is marred, make right;</div>
      <div class='line in13'>What is severed, unite;</div>
      <div class='line'>And leave where’er you pass love’s golden thread of light!’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>“That’s a pretty little story!” said Eddy,
as his brother wound off the end of his skein.
“You must teach me the tiny fairy’s song—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<i>What is marred, make right.</i>’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Just say it over again once or twice, Georgie.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What do you think of it?” said I to Mrs.
Scissors.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, you know very well that it is not in
my line,” she replied, in a snappish manner;
“I sever what is united, and cut right and
left! I would not stoop to the office of a
needle!”</p>

  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di-t.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
THE story told by George, however gratifying
to my feelings as a needle, did
not prevent me from dwelling a good
deal on the troubles of his parents,
and wondering if any letter had arrived from
Bristol. I seldom saw Mr. Ellerslie in the
drawing-room, where I was kept, till he returned
from business late in the afternoon.
This day, when he entered the apartment with
his wife, he looked gloomy and anxious as
ever.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There is a late post; we may hear to-night,”
the lady said. He muttered something, I could
not make out what.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Ellerslie was very irritable that evening;
he could scarcely bear the children near him at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>all. Eddy made a vain attempt to repeat to
him the fairy’s song, of which the rhyme had
caught the child’s fancy. He and his sister
were soon sent up to the nursery; but George,
as being older and more quiet, was suffered to
remain behind.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Ellerslie, with forced cheerfulness, did
all that she could to make the heavy time pass
pleasantly. She carefully avoided rousing her
husband’s temper, and when, without reason,
his peevishness broke forth, she bore it without
a murmur or complaint, and kept down the
tears which struggled to rise. I saw plainly
that iron is not the only thing liable to a speck
of rust, nor broken-pointed scissors the only
articles formed to cut and divide.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Ellerslie took up a book, a very amusing
volume it was, and read till her voice grew
hoarse and faint.</p>

<p class='c006'>“May I read a little, mother?” said George;
“it is good practice for me, you know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She placed the book in his hand; but it soon
became evident that George was not accustomed
to read aloud. He never varied his tone,
missed the short words and mispronounced the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>long, and certainly made a very poor figure as
a reader.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How you drawl! it is a penance to hear
you!” cried his father.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Shall I take the book now?” said Mrs.
Ellerslie faintly.</p>

<p class='c006'>George was flushed. I could see that he felt
his father’s taunt. I believe that he would gladly
have given up the reading; but his mother’s
feeble tone seemed to touch his heart, and still
retaining his hold of the volume, he said, “If
you please, I would rather try a little longer;
I will try to read better, if you will let me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There’s the post!” exclaimed Mrs. Ellerslie,
with a start, as the double rap was suddenly
heard.</p>

<p class='c006'>George saw that his mother was anxious: he
sprang out of the room in a moment.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Ellerslie rose, as if too impatient to be
able to sit still; his wife clasped her trembling
hands; but neither of them uttered a word till
George returned with a letter.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The Bristol post-mark!” muttered Mr.
Ellerslie, as he broke the seal.</p>

<p class='c006'>“George, my son,” said the lady, “go to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>dining-room for a few minutes. You can take
the book with you, if you like.”</p>

<p class='c006'>George instantly obeyed, without speaking;
and Mrs. Ellerslie fixed her blue eyes, with a
look of intense anxiety, on the changing countenance
of her husband.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There—read it,” he exclaimed, when he
had finished perusing the letter; “what do
you say, Eliza, to that?” and he threw himself
again on his chair.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He writes kindly of George,” said the
mother, after looking over the first page of the
letter,—“‘<i>I was much pleased with what I
saw of your boy last year,—I don’t forget that
he is my namesake.</i>’” The poor mother’s face
brightened up.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Read on,” said her husband abruptly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It does not seem that he declines to assist
you,” said the lady, still anxiously endeavouring
to make out the crabbed handwriting before
her; “on the contrary,” he writes, ‘<i>I shall have
a large sum at your disposal, such as I think
will remove every difficulty.</i>’”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There’s an <i>if</i> to that. Read on a little
farther.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>“Oh, Edward!” exclaimed the lady, almost
dropping the letter, “can he ask us to give up
our boy—our dear son?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He offers to adopt him as his own.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“My George! oh! no, no, no!—we can
never, never consent to that!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, you see, Eliza,” said her husband,
speaking rapidly, “if I have not assistance now,
all will be ruin—I shall have no means of supporting
my family. Perhaps this is the best
thing for George himself—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I can hardly think it,” said the mother,
with a look of intense pain. “Hardcastle
gives us to understand that the separation from
our boy must be ‘<i>complete—final</i>’—these are
his very words—that ‘<i>George must not look
to two fathers or two homes</i>—’”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hardcastle dislikes me,” muttered Mr.
Ellerslie to himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And even if we could bear to part,” continued
his wife, with something like a stifled
sob, “Hardcastle is not one to whom our boy
could look up with the affection—the reverence—”
she stopped for a moment, as if to
swallow down her tears. “Hardcastle has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>temper, he is strange, eccentric. Our George
would be wretched with him. Oh no! it cannot
be!” she added with energy; “it would
be like sacrificing—selling our child!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If we refuse Hardcastle’s offer,” said her
husband, “we offend him for ever; and you
know the consequences, Eliza.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She sat with her hand pressed over her eyes,
while Mr. Ellerslie continued to speak,</p>

<p class='c006'>“He can afford George advantages, comforts,
which it would not be in our power to
bestow. I am not certain whether, all selfish
motives set aside, the boy would not be happier
at Bristol than here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let us consult George himself,” said the
unhappy mother. “On a question which concerns
the welfare of his whole life, we at least
should know what are the poor child’s feelings.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have no objection,” replied the father,
walking to the door; “but you must command
yourself, Eliza. This is weak, foolish—not
what I expected from you. We must think
calmly, and decide firmly, and not give way to
emotions which injure ourselves and can do good
to none.—George!” he called out, after opening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>the door, while his wife, after one look of
anguish, such as I never can forget, sat quiet
and submissive on the sofa, like one whose
spirit is broken and crushed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Did you call me, father?” said George, as
he entered with his light step and cheerful
glance.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes; I wish to speak to you, my boy.
You remember your visit to Bristol last summer?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That I do!” replied the school-boy with a
meaning smile; “I know that I was precious
glad when it was over!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You had nothing to complain of—Mr.
Hardcastle was kind?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, kind after his fashion,” said George,
with a little hesitation. “I did not mean to
say anything against him. But what with the
smoke and the dirt, and the noise of the great
manufactory close by, and the ways of the
house—not one bit like ours—I know that I
felt like a bird in a cage, and was heartily
glad when I was set free!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I knew it!” murmured the mother; but
I believe that no one overheard her but myself.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Mr. Ellerslie knitted his brow. “Hardcastle
wishes you to go to him,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not another visit, I hope?” exclaimed
George with animation; “you do not know
how much I should hate it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not for a visit—he would have you for
good and all.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But he won’t get me!” cried the school-boy
with playful confidence. “I would not
change my own dear home for that smoky
prison, no, not for all England—and Ireland to
boot!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He shall not go!—oh, Edward, he cannot
go!” exclaimed the mother, rising and throwing
her arms round her son, and pressing him
convulsively to her heart. “I would sooner
starve than send him away!”</p>

<p class='c006'>George was startled and alarmed at the sight
of her agitation, and looked anxiously at his
father for an explanation of an emotion which
he could not understand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is as well that he should know all,” said
Mr. Ellerslie; “let the boy decide for himself.—George,
driven by circumstances which I need
not explain, I have asked a favour of Mr. Hardcastle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>on which the comfort, the independence,
I may say the very living, of this family depend.
This is his answer; read it.” He
pushed the letter across the table to George.</p>

<p class='c006'>All the healthy glow in the boy’s cheek
faded away as he slowly made out the closely-written
scrawl. His father folded his arms,
and fixed his gaze sternly on the carpet; but
his mother watched him with glistening eyes.
George stopped more than once as he read, as
if to make sure that he rightly understood, and
repeated the words “<i>final and complete separation</i>”
as he might have done a sentence of
death. When he had finished he laid down the
letter, and turning towards the sofa, said, in a
low, agitated tone, “Mother, what would you
wish me to do?”</p>

<p class='c006'>She buried her face in her hands.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do not further distress your mother,” said
Mr. Ellerslie, rising with emotion. “I leave
the question in your own hands, George; I will
never dispose of you without your own consent:”
and as he spoke I thought that the
hand which he laid on the shoulder of his first-born
trembled.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>George had evident difficulty in speaking.
He could scarcely command his voice. I
expected him to break down every moment;
but he manfully struggled with his feelings.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I should like one night, dear father, to
think over it, before I make up my mind.
Mr. Hardcastle says in his postscript”—he
took up the letter and read—“‘<i>As business
takes me to London, I shall arrive almost as
soon as my letter, and will see you on Saturday
morning</i>;’ so, doubtless, he will be here
to-morrow. May I wait till the morning before
I give you my answer?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Certainly,” replied Mr. Ellerslie, with a
heavy sigh. “You had better retire to rest
now; it is late. I shall wait at home to-morrow
to see Hardcastle when he calls. You
will tell me your wishes in the morning.
George, my dear boy, good-night.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He pressed his son for a moment closely to
his breast, and then himself rapidly quitted the
room. George sprang to the side of his mother.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mother—darling mother!” his arms were
around her, his head buried on her bosom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, George, my heart will break—will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>break! I cannot part with you!—I can never
consent!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We will think, we will reflect over it,
mother.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And pray—oh, my child! we will pray!”</p>

“THAT’S right, Lily, place the books
ready; get everything right for dear
mother,” said George, as, with a step
and manner, oh, how changed! he
entered the drawing-room the next morning.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I want you to see that I do not forget
your advice. I am going to be a real comfort
to mamma.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And so am I!” cried Eddy, with glee.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“My healthy arm shall be her stay,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And I will wipe her tears away!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>He stopped short, and stared in wonder at his
brother. “Are you going to cry, Georgie?”
he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is the matter, George, dear George?”
cried Lily, looking alarmed.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>“Sit down beside me, dear Lily and Eddy,”
said George, when he had recovered his voice.
“I want to speak with you quietly and seriously—I
want to speak to you about our dear
parents.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But is anything the matter?” repeated Lily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am going to leave you—I am going to
Bristol—I—”</p>

<p class='c006'>He was interrupted by a passionate exclamation
from Lily, and something like a howl from
Eddy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wish you to take my place—to be to
those dear parents all that I once hoped to be;
to obey them cheerfully, without a murmur;
to try and find out their wishes, even before
they can speak them; to—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you shan’t go, Georgie; I won’t let
you go!” cried Eddy, seizing his brother’s arm
with both his hands, as if to detain him by
force.</p>

<p class='c006'>At that moment there was a knock at the
door, and George turned very pale at the sound.
The next minute Mrs. Ellerslie entered the
drawing-room to receive the expected visitor.
The lady’s eyes looked swollen and red, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>her form drooped like a withering flower.
Eddy popped a cushion on her chair, and Lily
drew a footstool before it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Ellerslie, whose voice had been heard on
the stairs in conversation with some one whose
cracked, peculiar tones grated harshly on the
ear, now threw open the door and followed into
the apartment a little shrunken figure, dressed
in a snuff-coloured coat, considerably the worse
for wear. I could not wonder, when I looked
at the visitor, at poor George’s reluctance to
exchange the society of all whom he loved so
well for that of his cousin at Bristol. There
was something shabby, mean, even dirty, in
his appearance, which gave the impression that
he was out of place in a gentleman’s house;
while a terrible squint in his left eye, and a
strange twitch in his face, which set Eddy
laughing, made his countenance the reverse of
agreeable.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hardcastle, in an uncouth, awkward
manner, shook hands with Mrs. Ellerslie, nodded
to Lily, and chucked Eddy good-humouredly
under the chin; then, clapping George heartily
on the back, he said, “So, my man, you are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>going back with me to Bristol! That’s right.
See that your trunk is packed by Monday;
we’ll be off by the early train.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I shall be ready, sir,” answered the boy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hardcastle sat down, pulled out his
snuff-box, took a pinch of its contents, part of
which he bestowed on the carpet, then held out
the box to Eddy, who examined with interest
the picture on the lid.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll arrange it with you, Ellerslie, to-day,”
said the old gentleman; “we’ll go to the city
together, make all right, set all smooth.” He
passed his fingers through his hair, and stretched
out his legs with an air of satisfaction, in
marvellous good-humour with himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am very sensible how much I am indebted
to you,” began Mr. Ellerslie, making an effort
to speak.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Say nothing about it, say nothing about
it—it’s all settled and done. When a man
comes half-way to meet me, why it’s my way
to go the other half to meet him. Eh, George?”
he added, as if appealing to the boy, who stood
silently and sadly leaning against the arm of
the sofa.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>George’s answer was a half-suppressed sigh.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You look glumpish,” said the old gentleman,
fixing the eye which did not squint on the
boy. “You don’t wish to go with me, eh?”—the
cracked voice had impatience in its tone.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wish to do—whatever is best for my
parents.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you don’t like going, eh?” said Mr.
Hardcastle, resting his bony hands on his knees,
and leaning forward with a look of peevish
irritability.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I cannot like—leaving my home for another,”
answered George gravely; “but I am
ready to do it—I do not complain.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hardcastle continued his sharp scrutiny
of the boy’s countenance, as if he would read
him through and through. There was a painful
moment of silence—it was broken by little
Eddy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You shan’t take away George,” said he,
going close to the old man, and looking
earnestly up into his face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I shan’t! shall I not? and why not, my
little man?” said Mr. Hardcastle, lifting the
child on his knee.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>“Because—because—Georgie must not be
sent far away like the compass, but stay here
at home like the needle.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Like what?” exclaimed Mr. Hardcastle,
laughing.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s a story Georgie told us,” said the child,
pulling the buttons on the coat of the old
gentleman.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let’s hear his story, by all means, my
dear.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Poor Eddy looked exceedingly puzzled, for
he had very little command of language, and
did not know how to put his thoughts into
words. At last he said, “Georgie told it to
make us good, and busy, and kind, and a comfort
to papa and mamma.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah! that must have been a capital story;
I should like to hear you tell me all about it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Eddy,” said his father, “how can you
plague Mr. Hardcastle with your nonsense?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I beg your pardon, he does not plague me
at all. It amuses me to hear what the little
fellow has to say. So out with your improving
story, Master Eddy!”</p>

<p><span class='c003'>Eddy tells his story.<br /><i>Page <a href='#Page_120'>120</a>.</i></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Poor Eddy turned round and looked at his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>brother; but George seemed disposed to render
him no assistance. He glanced at Lily—she
would not utter a word. He was left to his
own resources.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, once upon a time,” he began, but
stopped short. “I can’t tell a story,” said the
child; “it is too hard—I can only remember
a bit of the fairy’s pretty song.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A little is better than nothing,” cried the
old gentleman, much amused at the perplexed
look of the child. “Let’s hear what the fairy
sang.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It was something about what we all should
do, Georgie said. It made me think I
should like to do it too. This was it;” and
keeping time with his fore-finger, he slowly
repeated—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>“What is marred, make right;</div>
      <div class='line in15'>What is severed, unite;</div>
      <div class='line'>And leave where’er you pass love’s golden thread of light!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The hard features of the old man softened
as he listened to the lisping child. “That’s
the song, is it?” said he, stroking Eddy’s locks
in rather an abstracted manner. “What is
severed, unite,” he repeated to himself;—“here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>it is, <i>What is united, sever!</i>” and he glanced
at George and his mother.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That won’t do at all,” said Eddy, overhearing
him; “that sounds bad—shocking bad!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Does it?” said Mr. Hardcastle, laughing.
“Well, I really believe that it does. So George
teaches you to be busy, and obedient, and kind,
and makes you all happy; does he, eh?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh yes!” cried Eddy, jumping down and
running up to his brother.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It would be a shame to part you, then, it
would be a shame!” said the old man, rising.
“No, no; I am not so bad as that! George,
stay with your parents; you are an honour to
them, my boy! stay and be a comfort and
blessing in your home!—And now, Ellerslie,
shall we start for the city?”</p>

<p class='c006'>I shall not attempt to describe the deep,
intense joy which followed the utterance of
these few words, the delight which sparkled
in the eyes of George, or the fervent exclamation
of thankfulness from his mother!—but
none looked merrier than the kindhearted old
man himself, unless it were our little friend
Eddy.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>I have often thought of that scene since, and
talked it over with the Thimble. She has become
too small for Lily’s finger now, but occupies
a quiet corner in the box. The broken-pointed
Scissors I have lost sight of for years.
Lily has grown into a sweet, gentle young
maiden, ever watchful to show kindness to
those who need it, ever thoughtful of the feelings
of others. Her mother speaks of her now
as her “right hand;” and the bloom has returned
to the lady’s pale cheek, and her brow
is calm and serene. George has entered the
Church, I understand; and Eddy, like the compass
in the story, is pursuing his way on the
wide ocean. But I have reason to believe that,
in their different paths, both are pressing forward
to the same happy goal, and in their
intercourse with the world, as well as in their
peaceful home, are living in the spirit of the
song—</p>

“WHAT a proud, happy young fellow
that Prince Imperial must be!”
exclaimed Harry Lance, as he
glanced up from the newspaper
which he had been reading by the
light of a lamp, on the evening of the 4th of
August. “Why, here is this young Louis, not
a year older than myself, and already there is
a telegram about him darting all over Europe,
and the world will soon know how calm and
brave he was the first time that he ever saw
fighting, how he picked up the Prussian ball
which had fallen near his feet, and how old
soldiers had tears in their eyes to see their
boy Prince so firm in the moment of danger.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>I dare say that he will live to cover himself
with glory, and be as famous as was his great-uncle,
Napoleon the First. I only wish that I
were the son of the Emperor of the French!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I should not care to change places with
the Prince Imperial,” observed Arthur Lance,
who was seated by the open window, to enjoy
the fresh evening air, and watch the stars
gleaming out one by one in the sky.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What! not to have his chance of winning
glory, and of being talked of—like his great-uncle—years
and years after his death?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Arthur smiled at the question. “I don’t
think that would do him much good,” observed
he.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’ve not a spark of spirit in you
Arthur!” cried Harry; “at least not a spark
of the spirit of a hero. I do believe that you
would rather have been that missionary who
went to teach woolly-haired niggers, and died
of yellow fever, than the glorious Napoleon
Buonaparte himself!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Arthur was silent; but his mother, who
had just joined him by the window, observed,
“I believe that the missionary’s was the nobler
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>life, the happier death, and the more lasting
glory.”</p>

<p><span class='c003'>NAPOLEON AS A BOY DIRECTING A SNOW-BALL FIGHT.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, not <i>glory</i>, mother!” exclaimed Harry.
“There was no glory in the humdrum life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>which he led, and ten years hence no one will
so much as remember his name. Napoleon
had glory indeed! From his very boyhood he
was a leader of others. If his schoolfellows
had a mimic fight, it was Napoleon who
directed the battle, and taught future soldiers
to pelt each other with snow-balls, as they
would one day pelt their foes with something
more deadly. What power Napoleon had over
his men! How his words could rouse them
to rush to battle as if to a feast! How grand
and glorious he must have looked on a field
of battle, as he glanced down the columns of
armed men eager to follow him to victory, and
heard their shouts of <i>Vive l’Empereur</i>, as they
pressed forward to glory! One such hour of
Napoleon’s  life must have been worth ten years
of the life of a drudging teacher of niggers!”
The boy’s eyes sparkled with animation as he
spoke.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There was one hour of Napoleon’s life
when he is said to have himself played the
teacher, and I think that he appeared greater
then than on the battle-field,” said Mrs. Lance.
“I will show you a large print which I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>representing the scene. It describes an incident
which is said to have occurred on the
deck of a vessel in which Napoleon, then a
young officer, was making his voyage to Egypt.
A group of French officers had been conversing
together, speaking like the fool of whom we
read in the Bible, who says that <i>there is no
God</i>. The glittering stars were spangling the
sky above them, shining down as they have
shone for thousands of years, and bearing witness
to the power of their great Creator. <i>The
heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament
sheweth his handywork.</i> Napoleon
approached the unbelievers, lifted up his hand
towards the stars, and said, ‘Gentlemen, who
made <i>these</i>?’ The officers could not reply;
even their blinded souls could see the awful
truth taught by the stars—that there is, that
there must be, a great and glorious Creator!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But was Napoleon himself a religious
man?” inquired Arthur.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I fear that he was far from being so,” was
the reply. “No real Christian could for his
own wild ambition plunge nations into war,
and sacrifice the lives of hundreds of thousands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>of men. If Napoleon Buonaparte’s name is
written in history, it is written in blood, and
fire, and tears. I have often wished that the
stars, which preached one text to Napoleon,
could have preached one other to his heart;
then the conqueror would have felt that there
is a glory greater and more lasting than that
which earthly triumphs can give.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I cannot think what text you mean,” said
Arthur.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nor can I,” added his brother.</p>

<p class='c006'>Their mother left them to find it out, and
continued her observations. “The same stars
on which Napoleon had looked from the deck of
the ship, must often have met his gaze in the
distant lands to which he led his hosts—those
lands in which so many gallant soldiers were
to find their graves.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah! how fearfully the French suffered in
Russia,” interrupted Harry; “certainly there
Napoleon’s history was written in blood, and
fire, and tears. I’ve read how the Russians
burned their own beautiful city of Moscow,
that it might not give shelter to the invaders.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The Russians showed themselves to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>ready to make any sacrifice in order to drive
the French out of their land,” observed Mrs.
Lance. “The Russians fought bravely, but it
was the rigour of their wintry clime, the icy
wind, the falling snow, that proved more deadly
to the French than even the swords of their
foes. Multitudes of gallant men, who had
entered Russia full of hope and courage, perished
miserably under the snow. And who
can tell the grief in thousands and thousands
of homes in France, where widows and orphans
wept for fathers, brothers, sons, whom they
never should see again?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I own that Napoleon bought his glory too
dear,” said Harry gravely.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No doubt he thought so himself,” observed
Arthur, “when, as a prisoner in St. Helena,
he had plenty of time to remember all these
terrible things.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” said Mrs. Lance; “on that dreary
rocky isle bitterly must the mighty conqueror
have recalled the past. There, unchanged in
their calm brightness, the quiet stars shone
over him still, and they may have reminded
the exile—”</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>“Ha! what’s that?” interrupted Harry,
suddenly starting from his seat and rushing to
the window, as, with a rushing, whizzing noise,
a rocket shot up into the deep blue sky.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh! don’t you remember that we heard
that there were to be fireworks to-night in the
Earl’s grounds?” said Arthur. “I am so glad
that we shall be able to see the rockets over
the trees. Look—oh! look—there’s another!
it rises higher than the first!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How beautiful—how grand—how glorious
it is!” exclaimed Harry, clapping his hands
with delight. “It darts aloft like a conqueror
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>rising upwards and upwards; and there—see
how it bursts into a shower of stars—much
brighter than stars—filling the sky with its
spangles of light! There is nothing so glorious
to look upon as a rocket!”</p>

<p class='c006'>For nearly an hour the mother and her sons
watched the beautiful fireworks over the trees,
the rockets bursting on high into showers of
many-coloured sparks which entirely hid the
stars from view. Then, after the grandest
display of all, the sight concluded; all was
over, the beauty and the glory. Quiet night
reigned around, and the stars which had
gemmed the sky since the days of Adam,
glimmered again in their silent beauty on high.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The rockets were very fine, but their glory
was soon over,” observed Harry, as he turned
from the window. “They have gone, and
have left nothing behind.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They are types of worldly glory,” said his
mother.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And the stars are like—oh, mother,” exclaimed
Arthur, interrupting himself in the
midst of his sentence, “I have just remembered
the text which you wished that the stars had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>preached to the heart of Napoleon—it makes
me think of the young missionary who died
amongst the Africans whom he had led to the
Lord: <i>They that be wise shall shine as the
brightness of the firmament; and they that
turn many to righteousness as the stars for
ever and ever!</i>” (Dan. xii 3.)</p>

the Rhine. He had been her chief
comfort and helper since the day
when Carl Gesner, the hard-hearted
farmer, had turned her and her three children
out of their cottage the very afternoon on
which the funeral of her husband had taken
place. In the middle of winter the sobbing
widow had to go forth from her home; carrying
little with her, for Carl had seized on most
of her goods for the rent, which during her
husband’s long illness had fallen into arrears.
Yes! he had kept the very bed upon which
her husband had breathed his last; and but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>for the kindness of neighbours, Frau Arnt and
her children would have had to sleep on straw.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fritz had been but a young boy then; but
he had never forgotten the bitterness of that
moment when his mother, sad, sick, and desolate,
had pleaded with clasped hands to her
hard-hearted landlord for a little delay, and
had pleaded in vain. Fritz had helped to
nurse her through a dangerous illness which
followed. The boy had never forgiven the
farmer, but had often said in his heart that a
time would come when he should make Carl
Gesner bitterly repent having nearly caused
the death of a sorrowing widow.</p>

<p class='c006'>Since that sad winter Fritz had worked
hard to help to support the family, and with
increasing success. His wages for field labour
eked out what Frau Arnt earned at the lace-pillow;
and something like comfort was beginning
to be enjoyed in his humble home, when
the sound of the war-bugle was heard in his
native valley, and the news spread far and
wide that a fierce and terrible foe was on the
march to invade the German’s Fatherland.
Fritz was under the age for military service
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>which all Prussians are bound to give; but he
had a strong arm, and his country needed
strong arms. He was eager to serve his king,
and be one of the throngs that from every
hamlet were hasting to join the ranks of the
army.</p>

<p class='c006'>But Fritz was too good a son to go without
his widowed mother’s consent. He had not
only learned, but kept, that divine commandment,
<span class='sc'>Honour thy father and thy mother</span>.
The lad would not quit his home without
obtaining that leave which he was almost afraid
to ask.</p>

<p class='c006'>Frau Arnt was sitting with her lace-pillow
on her knee, the glow of the evening sun shining
on her thin, worn face, when Fritz drew
near. He watched for some moments her busy
fingers plying the threads, before he observed,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“My brother Wilhelm is a strong boy now,
and older than I was when we first came
here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He paused: there was no reply. The widow
guessed what was coming, and her fingers
moved faster than before.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Farmer Schwartz says that he would give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>Wilhelm my place, mother, and make his
wages the same as mine, if—”</p>

<p class='c006'>Fritz stopped again, and glanced anxiously
into the face of his mother. She suddenly
paused in her work; her hands were trembling
too much to guide the threads, and her
eyes were swimming in tears, so that she could
not see the pattern. Fritz knew then that his
mother read his thoughts, and that there was a
struggle in her mind between her love for him
and a sense of duty. It was some time before,
in a very low voice, he spoke again:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mother, men are needed to guard your
home and other homes. You have two sons;
will you not spare <i>one</i> to your Fatherland?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The widow suddenly rose; her pillow
dropped from her knee; her arms were thrown
around the neck of her son, and her face was
buried on his shoulder, as she sobbed forth,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Go, and the Lord be with thee, my son!”</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='c003'>FRITZ BIDDING GOOD-BYE TO HIS FRIENDS.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Very little time was spent in preparation by
Fritz. The very next day he set out for the
army. But before doing so, Fritz, accompanied
by Wilhelm and their sister, went round the
hamlet to bid good-bye to his friends. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>was but one house which Fritz would not
enter: it was that at whose door stood Carl
Gesner and his wife, watching him as he bade
farewell to friends on the opposite side of the
road. At that time of excitement all Prussians
were ready to show kindness to the brave
defenders of their land; and Fritz knew that
even Carl might be willing to make friends
with a young soldier then, for the farmer had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>such patriotic zeal as to talk of joining the
army himself. But Fritz would have nothing
to do with Carl Gesner. “I will never cross
the threshold nor grasp the hand of a man
who turned us all out of doors, and nearly
killed my mother,” muttered Fritz to himself,
as he strode past the house of the farmer.</p>

<p class='c006'>I will not dwell upon the bitter parting.
Frau Arnt felt as if her heart would break;
for she had heard so much of the power of
France, that she deemed that her country was
entering on a desperate struggle indeed, and
that there was small chance that she would
ever again behold her gallant young son. But
the frau was a pious woman: she committed
her boy to the care of a heavenly Father; and
her last words to Fritz as they parted were,
“Remember that it is God that giveth the
victory.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Often these encouraging words came back to
the young soldier’s mind, as he marched with
his comrades singing the soul-stirring song,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Dear Fatherland! no fear be thine;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Firm hearts and true watch by the Rhine!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The regiment to which Fritz was attached
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>was not engaged in the first battles. Several
weeks passed before the youth was brought
face to face with strife and death. The time
was not spent idly. Fritz learned much that
a soldier must know: he learned not only his
drill exercise, but also how to endure hardship
and toil.</p>

<p class='c006'>At last Fritz’s regiment joined one of the
army corps on the eve of a great battle. At
the end of a long march Fritz reached the
Prussian camp, and from a hill-side looked for
the first time on the enemy’s hosts ranged on
the opposite slopes. They were near enough
for Fritz to catch the faint sound of their
trumpet-call as the sun went down—near
enough for him to distinguish the colour of
their flags, before night shut out all but camp-fires
from his view. And Fritz heard and saw
what made his heart beat fast—the booming
of French cannon, and the puffs of white smoke
which rose above them; for a few shots were
exchanged on that evening between the two
armies that were so soon to close in deadly
strife.</p>

<p class='c006'>The eve of a first battle is a solemn time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>even to the bravest of men. “One of these
cannon may bring <i>my</i> death-summons to-morrow,”
thought Fritz, as he stood leaning on
his gun, with his eyes turned towards the
enemy’s quarters, which darkness was now
shrouding from his sight. Then from the lad’s
lips rose the German battle-prayer—that noble
hymn composed by the poet Körner, who fell
defending his country against the First Napoleon:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>“Father, I call on Thee!</div>
      <div class='line'>Through the dense smoke the war-thunder is pealing;</div>
      <div class='line'>Over my head the fierce lightning is wheeling:</div>
      <div class='line in7'>Ruler of armies, I call on thee;</div>
      <div class='line in7'>Father, O guide Thou me!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>“Father, now lead me on!</div>
      <div class='line'>Lead me to slaughter, or lead me to glory;</div>
      <div class='line'>Since Thou ordainest whatever is before me,</div>
      <div class='line in7'>Whate’er Thou willest, Thy will be done</div>
      <div class='line in7'>To Thee I bow alone!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>“Father, O bless and guide!</div>
      <div class='line'>Thine is my life, and to Thee I commend it;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou didst bestow it, and Thou canst defend it:</div>
      <div class='line in7'>In life, in death, with me abide,</div>
      <div class='line in7'>And be Thou glorified!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>“And can I thus calmly commend my spirit
to my heavenly Father?” thought Fritz. “If,
as is likely enough, I am to be one of those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>who will lie stiff and stark in yon valley before
the setting of to-morrow’s sun, am I sure that
I have made my peace with God so that death
need have no terrors for me?”—In how many
brave souls must such thoughts arise on the
eve of battle!</p>

<p class='c006'>“My mother has often told me that we are
saved by <i>faith</i>”—thus Fritz went on with his
musings—“and I can say from my heart that
I do believe. Yes! I believe in Him through
whom is forgiveness of sins; I believe in His
mercy, His merits, His Word”—Fritz almost
started, for at that moment one sentence spoken
by the Holy One flashed across his memory,
and by that sentence he stood condemned:—“<span class='sc'>If
ye forgive not men their trespasses,
neither will your Father forgive your
trespasses</span>.” Fritz Arnt thought of Carl
Gesner.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have I not nourished hatred and malice
in my heart for years?” thought the young
soldier. “Then have my very prayers been a
mockery; then am I still <span class='fss'>UNFORGIVEN</span>. I
dare face an earthly foe, but how dare I face
a heavenly Judge? But how can I conquer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>these feelings of dislike and revenge—these
enemies in my heart? They seem to be part
of my very nature.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then the night breeze seemed to whisper to
the young soldier the words last heard from
the lips of his mother,—“<i>It is God that giveth
the victory</i>.” Fritz sank on his knees and
prayed, not now for help in the coming strife
with the enemies of his country, but for help in
the present struggle with the enemies of his soul.</p>

<p class='c006'>Very fearful was the battle on the following
day. Let us pass over the fearful details, nor
describe how God’s creatures destroyed each
other by thousands, till the Germans fought
their way to victory over heaps of the slain.
Their triumph was dearly purchased indeed;
numbers of their bravest fell beneath the deadly
fire of the French. Fritz rushed forward, with
a few soldiers of his own and of another regiment,
to seize a French gun which had made
terrible havoc in the Prussian lines. Almost
before the smoke from the last discharge of
that gun had cleared away, there was a hand-to-hand
struggle around it. In the confusion
of that struggle Fritz saw a Prussian fall under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>a blow from a Frenchman’s sword. Even as
he fell, Fritz caught a glimpse of his face:
begrimed as it was with smoke and dust, the
young soldier recognized the features of Carl
Gesner! The Frenchman’s sword was raised
again to kill the prostrate Prussian; but Fritz
sprang forward, warded the blow, and at the
same moment himself fell to the earth, struck
in the thigh by a musket ball from another
quarter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sudden darkness seemed to come over the
wounded youth. A rushing noise in his ears
drowned even the roar of cannon and the sound
of tumult and shouting. Fritz Arnt swooned,
and lay for many hours senseless under the
muzzle of the gun which he had helped to
capture.</p>

<p class='c006'>When Fritz again opened his eyes, the
tumult had died away; the battle was over;
the calm stars were looking down from the
midnight sky upon heaps of dead and dying.
Fritz was in severe pain, but gradually quite
recovered his senses, and could think again on
his mother, and silently lift up his heart in the
battle-prayer.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>“Oh for one drop of water! I am dying
of thirst!” groaned a wounded Prussian beside
him.</p>

<p class='c006'>The voice was that of Carl Gesner, who lay
within a yard’s length of the youth who had
saved his life from the Frenchman’s sword.
Fritz made no reply. His lips too were
parched and dry, and the fever thirst was upon
him. Oh, how he longed for one draught of
the pure fresh spring which gushed forth near
the home of his widowed mother!</p>

<p class='c006'>Presently lights were seen moving over the
dark field: helpers of the wounded were going
about on their errand of mercy. But there
were too few of them to do the work quickly;
for so many poor soldiers lay low that it was
impossible in one night to relieve the terrible
wants of all. With keen anxiety Fritz watched
the distant lights, while Carl Gesner lay groaning
beside him. At last a torch-bearer drew
near, with a companion who bore a red cross on
his arm and a large water-flask in his hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I must go back to refill the flask; there
are but a few drops of water left in it,” observed
one of the men.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Fritz half raised himself on his elbow with
a desperate effort.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Help! help!” he cried out; for the very
name of water made his thirst more intense.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here, my poor fellow! would that I had
more with me!” said the bearer of the flask,
stooping down to pour its last contents into
the mouth of the wounded young soldier.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was again a faint groan from Carl
Gesner. He was then too faint to speak, but
his groan fell on the ear of Fritz Arnt. “<span class='sc'>If
thine enemy thirst, give him to drink</span>.”
Fritz in the midst of his pain and want remembered
the Lord’s command.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Give it to that man instead,” he murmured;
“he is more badly wounded than I
am.” And with the generous request on his
lips the brave soldier fainted again.</p>

<p class='c006'>There lay Fritz, twice a conqueror—over
the foe, and over himself. God had given him
the victory.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c006'>When Fritz awoke again from what had
seemed the slumber of death, he found himself
in an hospital, to which the helpers of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>wounded had borne him. There he lay for
many weeks, during the latter part of the time
nursed by his own dear mother. During his
slow recovery, Fritz was cheered by the knowledge
that he had been enabled to do his duty,
and by tidings of one triumph after another
gained by the arms of Prussia.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fritz was at length able to leave the hospital,
but he was too lame to rejoin the army.
He had to go back with his mother to their
poor home, which would be poorer, Fritz
thought, than ever; for he was too weak for
labour, and while his mother had been nursing
him, she could not earn money by work.</p>

<p class='c006'>On a morning in September, Frau Arnt and
her wounded son returned to their native village.
Fritz, weak and lame, had to lean on
his mother’s arm for support, as the two walked
the short distance from the railway station.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Strange that Wilhelm should not have
been here to welcome us!” observed the widow.
“He cannot have received my note to tell of
our coming.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t let us pass our old cottage, mother,”
said Fritz faintly. “I have never liked to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>go near it since Carl Gesner turned us out
of it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nay, my son; we must take the shortest
path home,” said the widow. “And as for
Carl Gesner, have you not told me how freely
you have forgiven him?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Turning a corner of the road as she spoke,
the old cottage lay straight before her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, there is Carl Gesner himself,” exclaimed
Fritz, “nailing something to the wall!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And Wilhelm helping him in his work!”
cried the widow, in great surprise.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the sound of his mother’s voice, Wilhelm
turned suddenly round, and, at the sight of her
and his brother, uttered a loud exclamation.
The boy then bounded towards them, his eyes
sparkling with joy at Fritz’s return, and with
another joy the cause of which he had yet to
keep a secret.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was not a secret long. The glad exclamation
uttered by Wilhelm drew the attention of
Carl Gesner, whose back had been turned.
The moment that he saw Fritz Arnt he hastened
towards him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My brother-soldier, my brave young preserver,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>welcome!” cried Carl, holding out his
hand; and Fritz would not now refuse to
exchange a cordial grasp with the man whom
he once had hated. “I joined the army soon
after you did,” continued Carl Gesner. “Like
yourself, I have had to leave it on account of
my wounds, though my recovery has been more
rapid than yours. You look weary, but rest is
at hand. Here is your home; it is put into
perfect repair. Let us enter it now together.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Our</i> home!” exclaimed Fritz and his
mother in a breath.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, yours to the end of your days,” said
Carl Gesner. “Frau Arnt, I owe to your
noble boy my life; and more than my life. I
do not attempt to repay my debt by the gift
of his father’s cottage, which I would that you
had never left. I but show that I acknowledge
that debt. You will find the place
improved,” he added, more cheerfully. “We
have been planting creepers to train up the
wall; and I have had a board painted, to be
hung up just below the lattice, to serve as a
memorial of the battle in which Fritz and I
fought side by side.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Carl Gesner took up the board as he spoke,
and turned it so that all could see the gilded
letters upon it. Fritz glanced at the inscription,
then at his mother, and smiled. Was it
not strange that Carl Gesner should have
happened to choose for the motto on the wall
of the cottage the very words which had had
such a deep effect on the heart of Fritz?
There they were, to shine brightly from henceforth
on his happy home, the parting words of
his mother,—</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>BEARING BURDENS.</h2>
</div>
<div class='c010'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di-b.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
“B<i>EAR ye one another’s burdens</i>,” said
David Jones to himself, repeating
the text as he walked home from
church. “Our pastor has made it
very plain. In this world, he says,
every soul has some burden of sorrow or trial
to bear, and every one who loves God must try
to help his neighbour to bear it. Now it is
clear enough that the squire does this when he
gives blankets and coals to the poor at Christmas;
and our parson does this, for every one in
trouble is sure to go straight to him; but I
can’t see how a boy like me is to do it. I can’t
give like the squire, or talk like the parson;
yet I should like to help to bear some one’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>burden; for, as it was said in the sermon, it
is a blessed thing to do anything for the Lord
who has done everything for us; and when we
help a poor neighbour for His sake, He counts
it as done to Himself. I’ll pray God to show
me some way of bearing another’s burdens.”</p>

<p class='c006'>So before David went to rest that night, he
made a little simple prayer that God would
give him some work, however small, to do for
Him, and let him be useful to others.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first thought of David, when the bright
rays of the sun awoke him on Monday morning,
was,—“Here is another day; I hope that
it will not pass over without my helping some
one to bear his burden;” and again he turned
the thought into a prayer. While David was
putting on his clothes, an idea came into his
mind,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Poor old Mrs. Crane, she is almost bent
double with age, and hard work it is for her to
draw up water from her well. She is a good
old woman, Mrs. Crane, and was always ready
to help others before she grew so feeble. I’ll
have time, before I set out for school, to draw
up a pail of water and carry it to her door.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Won’t it be a nice surprise to her, when she
comes out to draw, to find the water all ready!
Old age is her burden—I can help her a little
to bear it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>David was soon off to the well. He let
down the bucket and filled it; and as he
turned the windlass to raise it again, a very
sweet thought came into the mind of the boy.
“Our Lord asked the woman of Samaria to
draw water for Him, and she did not do it;
yet what an honour it would have been to her—had
she been a queen—to have drawn water
for the Son of God! Now the Lord said, <i>Inasmuch
as ye did it unto the least of these my
brethren, ye did it unto Me</i>;” so I really am
doing what the woman would not do,—I am
drawing water for the blessed Saviour; for I
am sure that Mrs. Crane is His servant, and so,
working for her, I am working for Him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The boy cheerfully placed the pail of water
at the door of Mrs. Crane, and soon after set
out for school, carrying with him his dinner of
bread and cheese, wrapped up in a bit of brown
paper. “I am glad that I have done one little
kind act to-day,” thought David; “but it does
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>not seem very likely that I shall be able to do
any other.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He very soon found that he was wrong.
There are so many burdens, great and small,
in the world, that even a child who is on the
look-out for an opportunity of doing good, will
not wait long before he find one.</p>

<p class='c006'>David overtook on the road little Steeney
Clark, who was slowly walking towards school.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good morning, Steeney,” cried David.
“Why do you look so dull and sad?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“’Cause I’m sure Mr. Day will punish me
again,” answered the poor dull boy, who was
always getting into trouble with the master at
his school. “I didn’t know my lesson yesterday,
I don’t know it to-day, I don’t think as I
ever shall know it!” and the boy rubbed his
forehead hard, as if he fancied that he could
make his wits brighter by rubbing.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let’s see what you have to learn,” said
David. “Maybe if you and I go over it together
as we walk along, you may understand
it a bit better. Pluck up a brave heart, Steeney.
You know ‘perseverance conquers difficulties,’
and ‘slow and steady wins the race.’”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>It was very cheering to poor Steeney to have
some one to help and encourage him, instead
of laughing at his natural dulness. David was
one of the sharpest boys in the school, but he
did not despise his poor young companion for
not being so clever as himself. As the two
walked on together, David explained all the
difficulties of the lesson so clearly to Steeney,
that the dull face of the boy brightened. He
was able at last to master the task—he would
not be set down as a hopeless dunce by his
master. David entered the school-room feeling
very happy. He had helped a fellow-creature
again to bear a burden.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How pale Mr. Day looks,” thought David,
as the schoolmaster stood up behind his desk
and rapped with the ruler to command silence.
Mr. Day was not a great favourite with the
boys, for he was sometimes severe, and easily
put out of temper. The truth was that his
work was too much for him, as any one might
have seen by looking at his thin worn face with
its deep furrow between the brows. Mr. Day
would have liked David for his quickness in
learning, but for the trouble which he gave by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>his love of frolic and fun; for David was a
very merry boy, and could scarcely keep quiet
in school-time. He would drum on a desk, or
kick on the floor, and set the other boys laughing.
David had never seen much harm in
this, though it had often brought him into a
scrape with the master; but it struck him this
day for the first time that it was not fair to a
tired hard-worked master to add to the labour
of teaching.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mr. Day looks as if he’d a mighty heavy
burden to bear, and I’m afraid I’ve often helped
to make it heavier. I’ll try and be quiet and
steady to-day, and set a good example to the
boys about me,” thought David.</p>

<p class='c006'>He kept his resolution; and glad indeed
would he have been that he had done so, had
he known with what an aching heart and aching
head the poor master had begun his day’s
work. Mr. Day had private griefs, about
which his pupils knew nothing, which sorely
imbittered his life. He was also subject to
racking headaches, which the noise of a school-room
increased to such a painful degree, that
he would long before have given up his office,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>had he not had a wife and children to support.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I fear that I cannot stand this work much
longer,” poor Mr. Day had said to himself that
morning. He was like a weary pack-horse
dragging a weight beyond its strength up a
steep hill; and, from mere thoughtlessness, his
pupils had often acted like boys dragging on
behind. But things went on better on this
Monday; and Mr. Day told his wife as they sat
down to dinner that he had had much less
worry than usual with the boys. He did not
guess the cause of the relief—that one of his
best scholars had been on that day helping to
bear his burden.</p>

<p class='c006'>David Jones, as I have said, had brought
with him his dinner of bread and cheese, as his
home was at some distance from the school.
He sat down under a hedge with a good appetite
to enjoy his simple meal. Scarcely had
David begun it, when, chancing to raise his
eyes, he saw a ragged half-starved-looking
child, wistfully watching him as he ate.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I dare say that poor little creature has had
no breakfast to-day,” thought David, “and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>maybe no supper last night. Should I not be
doing a little thing to please my Lord if I
shared my dinner with her?”</p>

<p class='c006'>He broke off a piece of bread, and, smiling,
held it out to the girl, who eagerly ran forward
to get it, and ate it as if she were famished.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And there’s a bit of the cheese too,” said
David kindly, watching the hungry girl’s enjoyment
with a pleasure which made his own
scanty meal appear like a feast. David knew
well that our best works <i>deserve no reward from
God</i>, yet he could not but recall with joy the
gracious promise to those who feed the poor:
<i>They cannot recompense thee; for thou shalt be
recompensed at the resurrection of the just</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>When afternoon lessons were over, David,
whistling as he went, set out on his homeward
way. “It is a strange thing,” thought he,
“but whenever we try to bear other people’s
burdens, it seems as if our own hearts grew
lighter and lighter!”</p>

<p class='c006'>As David passed by an orchard, divided from
the road by a rough stone wall, he heard a
voice calling to him, and came up to Owen
Pell—a boy of about his own age—who was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>looking up at the fine ripe fruit hanging almost
over the wall.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I say, Davy; lend me a hand. I think I
can climb over here.” He was already mounting
the wall. “Let’s fill our pockets with
apples. Don’t they look tempting and nice?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nice or not, they’re not ours,” replied
David, who remembered that God’s commandment,
<i>Thou shalt not steal</i>, is broken not only
by robbers who take a man’s purse, but by
boys who take his apples.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We’ll soon make ’em ours,” laughed Owen.
“If you don’t choose to climb yourself—though
I know you’re active as a kitten—just lend
me your stick, and I’ll knock some fruit off
from that bough.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, no, Owen,” said David; “leave the
apples alone. Farmer Ford does not grow
them for you or for me. I’ll neither pluck nor
help you to pluck them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, indeed!” cried the angry Owen.
“You’re afeard of a thrashing from the farmer,
are you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s not that I’m afraid of,” said David,
turning quickly away; for he felt his passion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>rising, and was much inclined to use his stick
in a very different way from that which the
insolent boy had requested, by knocking him
down instead of the apples.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I can’t bear that Owen,” muttered David
to himself. “How he is yelling after me,
calling me all sorts of bad names, just because
I won’t join him in theft!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Before David reached his home, he came on
a wide tract of common, and noticed a number
of ducks splashing about in a pool half hidden
by rushes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, these are Mrs. Pell’s ducks, that
her boy Owen ought to be watching on the
common, instead of hunting after apples. I
heard her scolding him yesterday for leaving
them out so late, and promising him a sound
beating if any should stray and get lost.
There’s Brown’s big dog coming this way; he
has had a mind to a duckling for supper before
now. If Owen does not keep a better look-out,
it’s not many of the brood that he’ll ever drive
home. What a scrape he’ll be in! When Mrs. Pell
promises a beating, she is certain to keep her word.
Well, let Owen be beaten,—what do I care!”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>That was David’s first thought; but a more
generous one succeeded. “I might drive home
these ducks for Owen, and keep them and him
out of trouble. To be sure, he deserves nothing
from me; but are we not told to be kind even
to the unthankful and the evil? I should
think that God is pleased when we bear the
burdens of our friends; more pleased when we
bear the burdens of strangers; but most pleased
of all when, for His sake, we show kindness to
those who have done us a wrong.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In the meantime, Owen Pell had had cause
to regret that he had neglected his mother’s
ducks to go after the farmer’s apples. Owen
was not an active boy. In struggling to climb
up the wall, he missed his footing, and came
down with a heavy bang on the back of his
head. He had just scrambled on his feet again,
bruised and crying with pain, when who should
ride up to the spot but Farmer Ford, with a
great horse-whip in his hand!</p>

<p class='c006'>“What are you crying for?” called out the
farmer.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ve had a tumble,” whined the frightened
boy.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“Climbing my wall to get at my apples!
I’ll give you something to cry for!” and the
rough farmer bestowed two or three sharp cuts
with his lash on poor Owen, which made him
yell with the smart, and sent him running
home in such haste to escape from the farmer’s
whip, that he never once thought of the ducks,
till he saw his mother—a tall, bony woman—standing
with a broom in her hand at the gate
of her little garden.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where are the ducks?” shouted she.</p>

<p class='c006'>Owen stopped, breathless and gasping, and
looked around in dismay. Evening was closing
in; his ducks had wandered he knew not
whither. Mrs. Pell came angrily towards him.
“I told you yesterday,” she exclaimed, raising
the broomstick, “that if one of them ducks
was lost—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“None are lost!—none are lost!” called out
a cheerful voice near; and from behind a knoll
covered with furze, which had hidden him from
view, appeared David Jones, driving home the
ducks for Owen.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, Davy, you’re a good-natured boy if
ever there was one!” cried Mrs. Pell, her hard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>features relaxing into a kindly look. “Owen
has escaped a beating this once, but next time
he shall not be so easily let off. You look
tired and heated, Davy,” she added. “Just
step into my cottage and rest; and if you’d
like a sup of new milk and a slice of plum-bread,
you’ll be heartily welcome to both.
There’s none for you,” she said sharply to
Owen. “Go and shut up those ducks.”</p>

<p class='c006'>David glanced at the boy as he slunk away.
“I’m glad,” he thought, “that I did a good
turn to that poor fellow, and saved him a
beating.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’ll always get on well in the world,
Davy,” observed Mrs. Pell, as she cut for him
a large slice of her home-made plum-bread.
“You always keep steady to your duty, and
you make friends wherever you go.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Pell was right. David passed through
boyhood, youth, and manhood, prospering in
what he undertook, till he became a wealthy
farmer. Always ready to help others, he found
others ready to help him. He made many
friends on earth, but it was through earnestly
seeking to please an Almighty Friend above.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>David had grown rich; and a noble use he
made of his riches. The more he gained, the
more he gave; and truly it appeared that the
more he gave, the more he had. When David
Jones had built the new aisle to the church,
and set up a village lending-library, sent
twenty pounds at once to the Bible Society,
pensioned several poor widows, and feasted a
hundred school children,—he might smile at
the remembrance of the day when he had
begun his work for God by such things as
filling an old woman’s pail, feeding a hungry
little girl, and driving home ducks from the
common. But perhaps the kind acts of the
penniless boy were as pleasing in the sight of
God as the great gifts of the rich farmer; for
they both sprang from the same motive,—a
desire to show grateful love to his Lord by
bearing the burdens of others.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
